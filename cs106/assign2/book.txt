THE
 LONELY STRONGHOLD



 CHAPTER I

 THE PALATINE BANK


The sleet drove spitefully against the dirty windows of the stuffy room
behind the Palatine Bank in the High Street of Bramforth

The air was close without being warm a smell of tea and toasted bread
lingered upon it The clock struck and the girls who sat upon their
high stools cramped over columns of figures straightened their backs
with long sighs of relief

Snakes What weather muttered Miss Hand as she pushed back her stool
until it almost overbalanced in her efforts to gaze at the December
night without

With my usual luck came without a gamp this morning grumbled Miss
Turner collecting loose sheets with a dexterity born of long practice

And youve got a mile to walk when you get off the tram exclaimed
Miss Donkin sympathetically

Mrs Barnes who presided seated not at a desk but at a central table
wiped her pen looking across the zoom with knitted brows

It has struck Miss Innes said she

The click of the typewriter went on nevertheless and the operator
replied without desisting from her work Let me get to the foot of this
page please

There began the rustle and murmur of the girls leaving their places in
what was described by the bank managers as The ladies room Mabel
Hirst a pretty girl with dark eyes ran to the fire and held her
chilblained hands to its warmth Oh my goody said she when will
old Storky start in on that chauffage centrale which he is always
gassing about

At the coming of the coquecigrues I should think said the voice of
Miss Innes who now ceased her clicking rose from her chair and raised
her arms above her head breathing a long Aah of relief

Not that I think it would be much improvement she went on It
probably wouldnt work Nothing does work in this old town and as
long as we have the fire there is at least one place where you can go
and thaw now and then

An electric bell rang twice

Hallo Barney old Storky wants you said Mabel Hirst Beg him to
accept my compliments and ask if he ever gives compensation for
chilblains

Tell him its my birthday tomorrow

Say you think my work during this past quarter merits a rise

Suggest he gives us a Christmas treatstalls for the panto

The chorus was practically simultaneous and Mrs Barnes put her hands
over her ears Im far more likely to ask permission to increase the
fines for talking was her parting shaft as she vanished in obedience
to the summons

You look a bit fagged Innes remarked Mabel Hirst as the typist
approached the fire and knelt down so that the flames shone upon her
small intense face

Oh its not fag so much as disgust she replied in a voice of
individual quality I dont think I can stick this any longer I
didnt take a secretarial training in order to type out rows of figures
all day long I am bored dearsbored stiff All my powers are wasting
their sweetness on the desert airor rather the town lack of air The
desert would be all right I shouldnt a scrap mind blushing unseen if
I had plenty of space to blush in Ouf I feel as if I should choke

She stared at the fire with firmly folded lips every line of her
slender person seeming to breathe the resentment she felt

Its pretty bad agreed Miss Turner who was lacing up her hoots
Suppose nobodys got a raincloak theyll be saint enough to lend

Yes replied Miss Innes you shall have mine I brought a gamp and
I havent far to walk But look heremind you bring it back

Course I will Tomorrow without fail moddum Oh this sleet It
really is something chronic

The dressingroom opened out of the office but in the absence of Barney
the connecting door stood wide against all rules and the girls went in
and out warming their boots before putting them on commenting on the
frozen waterpipes and kindred grievances after the manned of their
kind all the world over

In the midst of it the superintendent returned

Hallo What did the old bird want Give you the sack or tell you to
bestow it on any of us

Im sure it was about a Christmas tree for the young ladies in
recognition of the fine work they have put in

Nat quite that but the next best thing replied Barney in a cheerful
tone In view of the coming heavy work in the New Year you and I are
to have an extra day for Christmasthe 24th to the 28th What dyou
think of that

There was a whoop of joy and the babel of voices broke out anew

If only he would give us the day before instead of after sighed one
malcontent If we had Christmas Eve now

My dear you know thats impossible at a bank Take your extra day and
give thanks for it Its more than the men are getting was the
rejoinder of Mrs Barnes

Three whole days echoed Blanche Turner I shall have forgotten you
all by the time we reassemble Think of that Shant know you by
sight

I can easily believe that Having spent your holiday entirely at the
movies your sight will have given out jeered Miss Donkin Then
youll lose your job my girl

I shall go to Leeds to my aunt

And I to Driffield

And I home

The chatter waxed louder and louder as gradually girl after girl got
ready Then they began to depart drifting out by twos and threes
through a side door into an alley giving upon the High Street

Miss Innes was last She stood alone before the little lookingglass
fitting her hat dexterously upon her gleaming hair her eyes
mechanically assisting at the process but really far away with her busy
thoughts She had not anticipated such a violent downpour as greeted
her when she emerged into the street and as she crossed to await a
tram she half regretted her loan of her cloak to Miss Turner She was
lucky enough to get a place in the first car that passed Ten minutes
journey brought her to the residential suburb of the ugly town and as
she descended into the road the rain poured down upon her with such
vehemence that she took shelter under a tree for a minute in order to
get her breath and decide what to do

Struck by a happy idea she turned into a road close by and made her
way to a detached house standing inside a wall with two carriage gates
In the comparative shelter of the porch she halted and rang the bell

The middleaged servant who admitted her said with a smile that Mrs
Holroyd and Miss Gracie were in the diningroom

Miss Innes wiped the rain from her face placed her dripping umbrella in
the stand and opened the door of a hot overfurnished but comfortable
room in which a stout rather shapeless lady and a goodhumoured girl
who would be a duplicate of her mother in twenty years time sat at a
huge diningtable strewn with paper string and parcels

Olwen cried Gracie jumping up with a pleased cry of greeting

Why how do you do Were downright pleased to see you I was saying
to Gracie it was only yesterday that Ollie never takes advantage of
our invitation to drop in upon us any night on her way back from the
bank So here we are as usual Busy with the Christmas packing But
its almost done now and as I say to Gracie when its done its done
for a year thats one good thing

Olwen kissed the jolly lady I feel a regular beggar said she I
have come in now for the sordid reason that I want to borrow something
And you pay the penalty for being the kindest people I know

My dear Anything we can lend you

Olwen explained that her raincoat had been borrowed and that the storm
was so severe that she feared to reach the Vicarage wet through without
one If Gracie will lend me hers I can leave it as I go down tomorrow
morning said she

Well of course But now youre here wont you stay the evening
Pall be in and Ben for supper before so very long and well clear up
this mess in no time Now do child Think how pleased Benll be to
find you here

You are always so kind but I cant really To begin with I always
feel so soiled in my office frock Gracie will know what I mean And
to go on with this evening is my only time for any little Christmas
work that I have in hand Tomorrow night we shall almost certainly be
working overtime as they are giving us girls an extra day off and so
you see I simply must get back

An extra days holiday Well that is a bit of luck any way Now sit
down while Gracie gets you a bit of cake and a glass of port for you
look perished And tell me how the dear vicar is

Thanks Grandfather is wonderfully well

Thats right thats right I daresay he finds Mr Witherly a great
help in the parishso active and energetic Dear dear what a good
thing he bore up so well at the time of your dear grandmothers death
I said to Gracie I remember My dear this will mean the breakup of
our vicar But after all it was not He bore it nobly like the
Christian he is

Aunt Maud and Aunt Ada take care he shall feel it as little as
possible replied Olwen You see grandmamma had been ailing so long
before her death

Yes thats true enough sighed Mrs Holroyd Its a trial Ollie
as you will find when you get into years to be taken off your feet so
that you hinder the ones you have always been used to help I must say
I am thankful I can still get about

Get about indeed Walk me off my legs put in Gracie dryly

It was good to hear her mothers fat contented laugh

Oh well its your merry heart goes all the day said she and look
what a happy woman Ive always been with your father ready to cut off
his head and serve it up in a dish if hed a thought I wanted it and
such good children as Ive had my girls so well married my boys so
well started and now me left with Ben my eldest and Gracie my
youngest and the grandchildren now and then Now it was different
with your poor grandma One trouble after another Your poor dear
mothers unlucky marriage and sad death Your Uncle Charless
misfortune your Uncle Horaces sad end Oh she had her troubles
poor dear lady and no doubt she was glad to be at rest at last

Olwen listened with an indulgent smile on her expressive face Once
long ago she had determined to count the poors the dears and
IsaidtoGracies in Mrs Holroyds talk but had soon abandoned the
enterprise as hopeless Did you know that Aunt Ethel and her whole
family are coming for Christmas she asked

No my dear is that so  Well of course not but what there is
plenty of room in that great Vicarage for all  but let me see how
many children are there Five it must be

Five and a nurse said Olwen smiling

Well but dearie that is a great expense for the vicar

It is Uncle George who bears it not grandfather They bring two of
their own maids to help ours and I think everybody enjoys it Frank
and Marjorie are getting quite grown up now

Well I call that a very nice arrangement a good oldfashioned way to
keep Christmas Most sensible I daresay your Aunt Ethel knew the vicar
would be feeling his loneliness this year didnt she now Mrs
Holroyd expatiated for long on the subject She was still talking when
the front door was heard and Gracie with a sly glance at Olwen said

Theres Ben I do believe

Olwen had been so comfortable in the easy chair drawn up to the great
fire that she had stayed longer than she intended Ben Holroyd was the
reason why she did not oftener avail herself of his mothers unaffected
kindness The Holroyds were not aristocratic In fact when Mrs
Holroyd said packing up her accent came perilously near to the
paacking oop of the lower orders in Bramforth They were genuine and
hospitable and the girls life was starved not so starved however
that she was as yet ready to take Ben as a way out

He now entered the room a short stocky man of fiveandthirty even
now redder in the face than was strictly becoming and probably to grow
more so as years went on He had a ragged dark moustache and uneasy
eyes which seemed always apologising The goodhumoured simplicity
which made one pardon his mothers lack of breeding was wholly absent in
him He had fixed his heart upon Olwen Innes who was a very poor match
from a pecuniary point of view but whom he knew to be above him
socially

Gracie and Olwen had together received their education at the Bramforth
High School for Girls wherein Olwen had always been the show pupil and
Gracie at the bottom of her class Day by day the two had gone and
returned together with their satchels and lunch packets and there
subsisted between them a real friendship Had it not been for poor Ben
the friendship would have been closer as Gracie more than suspected

His face as he came in showed his delight He sat down by Olwen and
at his mothers instigation earnestly sought to make her reconsider her
decision and stay the evening She was resolute in her refusal and
Mrs Holroyd her heart sore for her boys disappointment bethought her
of the bit of information incautiously let drop before he came in

Never mind Bennie well do better said she cheerfully Ollie says
the bank is giving her an extra days holiday Now why cant you and
she and Gracie find somebody to make a fourth and take the train to
Leeds day after Boxing Day Lunch there and go to a mattinnay mother
standing treat Eh Hows that

Ben and Gracie thought this a brilliant suggestion Olwen did not see
how to decline it A matine at Leeds where an excellent company was
then performing was a treat she seldom obtained Mrs Holroyd proud
of her success ordered Ben to the telephone forthwith to engage seats
After a little more talk Olwen took her departure but as she had
foreboded Ben thought it necessary to escort her home She resisted as
firmly as was possible without rudeness but was obliged at last to give
in

Warmly wrapped in Gracies raincoat she found herself out in the storm
her hand linked to Bens sturdy arm while he held one umbrella over the
two of them

Mind the mud Miss Olwen The Council ought to have mended this road
last summer as I told my father

Yes indeed what is the use of a father in such an exalted position if
he cant get the road mended outside is own house laughed Olwen
hoping to keep this prosaic subject Inwardly her thoughts ran somewhat
thus

 Would it be possible Would even this be better than her present
life  Always had she been surrounded by the hosts of the
Philistines she who was born she was very certain upon the seacoast
of Bohemia  It was merely existence not life in the shabby
Vicarage with the two parochial aunts the weary old grandfather and
the periodical inrushes of the Whitefield clan Her Aunt Ethel had
married George Whitefield a man of no more exalted origin than Ben
Holroyd A millowner but a very wealthy one The Holroyds were only
comfortable

Could it be that she was so utterly contemptible that she was loath to
swallow poor Ben merely because the pill was insufficiently gilded 
Well it did make a difference Aunt Ethel lived in a palace She had
hothouses and motorcars her boy had been to the University Marriage
with Ben would mean a semidetached villa in a suburb of Bramforth
Dear Mrs Holroyd would present and consequently would expect to
choose the Brussels carpet and rep curtains and to lay the best
quality cork lino plentifully over halls and passage ways

You cant think how pleased I am that the bank has given you an extra
day Ben was saying when she began to listen It doesnt seem right
to me for the likes of you to be working there Why Flora Donkin the
butchers daughter is in your room isnt she

Certainly she is and a very good sort So neat I love copying out
her figures

But its not the place for you repeated Ben more fervently You
ought to have a home of your own and someone to take care of you all
the time

The moment for the inevitable cold water had arrived and she was forced
to throw it A declaration at this moment would be more than she could
bear Dear me how Early Victorian you are she laughed We girls
of the twentieth century dont want people to look after us We want to
live our own lives dont you know

He was silent swallowing down mortification He had got quite near
that time Then Gracie doesnt want to do that kind of thing he
muttered sulkily

Gracies vocation is very plain She has a mother who cant do without
her I have no home ties I can go where I like and do what I like

And what you like is the baank

She laughed Oh the banks all right she told him lightly Not for
worlds would she have divulged to him her deep dissatisfaction with
things as they were She could not tell him that she had secretly sent
an advertisement to the papers only a day or two previouslyan
advertisement to which she was at the moment feverishly awaiting
replies Aloud she went on Gracie and I are great friends but we
are not a bit alike you know She is the fine domestic type of woman
but that is just what Im not My father as you know was the reverse
of domestic I take after him

Ben felt very uncomfortable Madoc Innes Olwens father was what Ben
would have described as a bad hat He felt any allusion to this
discreditable parent to be in the nature of an indelicacy He knew that
Olwen was capricious and perverse but he held the steadfast belief of
many a good man that she would after marriage turn automatically into
just the woman he would have her be

Something in her made special appeal to him and had always done so
even in the days when she wore short skirts and long black stockings
and her remarkable hair had streamed in the wind all shaded from dun
colour to old gold The thought of her scapegrace father was the one
point upon which he was uncertain Olwen had accomplished her
intention They reached the Vicarage with no further attempt at
lovemaking on his part




 CHAPTER II

 OLWEN AT HOME


The large family of the Reverend James Wilson had been brought up on the
fringes of Dartmoor His income there was however of so inadequate a
nature in view of his domestic requirements that when the question of
education demanded heroic measures he accepted the living of Gratfield
a very large town in the industrial Midlandsa post for which both his
temperament and his habit of life hitherto made him singularly
illfitted

Of his seven children four were girls They were fine creatures with
white limbs blonde hair complexion of cream and roses Their natures
were placidly bovine except during that brief period in which a girls
own sense of her own beauty and the power it bestows kindles in her a
fictitious vivacity and nature for her own purposes lends a charm
which is incredibly fugitive

The young ladies made quite a sensation upon their arrival in Gratfield
Not long before Madoc Innes a clever young Welsh journalist had
bought the Gratfield Courier and settled in the place He was
handsome on a small scale and passed for richdrove good horses smoked
expensive cigars and was much in demand in a society where such young
men are rare

The sight of Clara Wilson at a ball set his Celtic blood on fire Her
Junolike loveliness made so powerful an appeal to his senses that the
limits of her mind or the faults of her disposition did not enter the
question She was stupid and she was essentially Philistine but he
shut his eyes to it until too late They were married and he committed
his first enormity by the purchase of a little old Elizabethan farm up
on the moor outside Gratfield planning to drive to his work each day

Clara detested the place She had had as much of moors and heather in
her childhood as would last her all her life What she desired was
shops and fine clothes plenty of company the chance to show off and be
admired For these things she had married and not for love of Madoc
with whose tastes she had no sympathy and whose disposition she would
have disliked had she ever given a thought to the subject

After the blind fashion of a man in love the young husband felt that he
had not won his wifes devotion long before he consciously admitted
anything of the kind He began by spoiling her outrageously giving her
all she craved in the vain hope that gifts might propitiate her and
incline her to a more favourableone might say a more
interestedattitude towards himself

Unhappily a year or two after the marriage his rising fortunes
underwent a sharp change

Being a Welshman he was a violent partisan and his knowledge of the
temper and prejudices of the North was very imperfect He attacked a
certain public character and found himself up against a stone wall of
implacable hostility A costly libel action left him a ruined man He
being thus deprived of what had been his sole asset in his wifes eyes
their lack of unity became at once nakedly apparent

He had plenty of courage and belief in himself He took his wife and
baby girl to London where he got work on a big daily and hoped for
better things

Clara however had no forgiveness for him She had married with one
object that of being well off and her failure was more sharply
accentuated in her eyes by the fact that Ethel her next sister had
made a conquest of George Whitefield only son and heir of the richest
millowner in Gratfield

Hopelessly out of sympathy the Innes pair drifted wider and wider
apart The discovery of his wifes indifference warped Madocs unstable
temperament Miserable at home he consoled himself elsewhere They ran
continually into debt there was even an execution in the house Scenes
grew frequent and even violent At last when Olwen was about seven
years old her father disappeared completely leaving behind an
envelope addressed to his wife containing a hundred pounds in
banknotes

Clara her beauty gone broken in health soured in temper returned
with her little daughter to her fathers rectory

She came at an unlucky turn in the family fortunes

It had long been apparent that twenty years of sloth in a tiny parish
in a mild and balmy climate had permanently unfitted the Rev James
Wilson for strenuous work and the rushing life of a big town After a
struggle hopeless from the first against his constitutional inertia
and the growing dissatisfaction of his parishioners he was stricken
down by severe illness His return to health was seriously retarded by
the sad climax of Claras marriage and the failure of his sons to do
anything to lighten his burden of undone work and unpaid bills

At this point his old college offered him the living of St Agnes
Bramforth about fifty miles further north It was a depressing
district semisuburban semiindustrial with an 1850 church
pewrented and a fluctuating congregation The income was however as
good as that of his present cure and the work less than half About
twelve months after the flight of Madoc Innes and fifteen years before
that Christmas when Olwen decided that the bank was intolerable the
family migrated to Bramforth and Mr Wilson with the assistance of a
curate thankfully lapsed into the stagnation which suited him

Olwens mother was at this time an invalid Three years later a
prominent surgeon diagnosed serious internal trouble She underwent an
operation failed to rally from the shock and died a few days later

The two younger Miss Wilsons Maud and Ada did not marry Perhaps they
looked too high for while in Gratfield they had not been without
admirers They were however still single and had borne with fine
unselfishness their share in the strain on the meagre family resources
involved by the necessity of supporting Clara and Claras child

Olwens memory of her father was vivid In fact she often thought that
the first seven years of her life had left a mark far deeper than those
that followed She was always striving in an unformed eager way to
arrive at the truth concerning the breach between her parents Her
mother remained in her memory as mostly fretful and complaining
uncertain in temper dissatisfied and uncontrolled She knew now that
Mrs Innes was a deeply wronged woman yet she could not escape the bias
of mind produced by the fact that she herself owed every hour of
happiness as a child to her father She remembered him as invariably
sweettempered and gayas a constant companion more like a
contemporaryliable as herself to incur the sudden and capricious wrath
of the mistress of the house

His upbringing had been cosmopolitan his parents having lived much
abroad To adapt himself to the Wilson standpoint had been from the
first impossible The laborious etiquette of the provinces was a matter
of which he could never grasp the importance That his wifes happiness
should depend upon such things as cardcases At Home days late
dinner or a drawingroom suite was to him unthinkable

Olwen remembered best of all their habit of escaping together They
went to remote corners of Hampstead Heath or Battersea Park or if he
were in funds to the Thames where they took a boat They spent long
days in makebelieve with a packet of picnic lunch and a few pence for
their omnibus ride home through the magic dusk of London His faculty
for storytelling was endless and one romance especially dear went on
in sections from week to week and was entitled Story of the Dandy
Lion and his four friends the Pale Policeman the Cheery Churchwarden
the Sad Sweep and the Tremendous Tramp An illustration of this group
of friends was one of her few mementoes of her vanished boon companion

From him too she heard the tales of the Mabinogion the Romance of
Kiluch and Olwenwhence came her own name so severely condemned by the
Wilson familythe Romance of Enid and Geraint and so on

This all made it hard for her to apportion the blame between the
sundered pair At the Vicarage of course all the guilt was heaped on
Madoc Innes She supposed this to be in fact just His temperament may
have been charming but his principles were apparently all wrong She saw
only part Yet as she grew older she found herself concentrating more
and more upon her mothers share in the debacle

That Clara Innes was unable either to sympathise with or to understand
her husband was the result presumably of her limitations and these one
would suppose she could not help Not until Olwen read her Pilgrims
Progress and learned with a sudden shock that Ignorance was thrust
down into hell did it occur to her that Ignorance is a crime since it
is a thing one may remedy if one chooses

Grumbling one grants is not a sin To fail in sympathy to your
husband is hardly a sin To make his home uncomfortable is not a sin
that is not of the sort called deadly But to be unfaithful to your
wife is a direct breach of a commandment Therefore in the Wilson
code Clara was innocent and her husband criminal To his other crimes
he added wife desertion which is a matter for the police courts Clara
had never done anything in her life which could conceivably have landed
her in the police court It was all very puzzling When Olwen had
spent time as she often did in considering the subject she usually
found that she ended by wishing that her father had taken her with him
when he fled She felt sure they could have been happy together

In her heart she knew herself for her fathers daughter and from the
Wilson point of view wholly alien It was typical of them that they
should so dislike her name for no reason but because they had never
heard it before The name of Owendolen just as Welsh and more
highfalutin in sound was quite popular in Bramforth because Owendolen
was in fairly common use Olwen was different and she was usually
called Ollie in hopes that the casual acquaintance might suppose her
baptismal name to be Olive a name which mysteriously enough was under
no ban

Her defaulting father had made no sign and sent no message upon the
occasion of his wifes death It was tacitly assumed that he was either
dead or had gone to some remote quarter of the globe where he was
living most probably under an alias

For nearly three years now Olwen had been selfsupporting At first her
post at the bank had possessed that elfin charm with which most
novelties are gilded when one is in ones teens Life itself is then a
romance the mere act of coming out into the streets on a fine morning
may be the beginning of endless adventure

Now the monotony had killed the novelty Her fathers restless blood
stirred and demanded relief She felt almost desperate as she let
herself into the Vicarage and pushed her streaming umbrella into the
untidy receptacle

A lowered jet of gas burned dimly in the hall Yet by its light she
could descry a letter upon the hall table addressed Miss O Innes St
Agnes Vicarage Bramforth

An answer to her advertisement at last A way of escape from the bank
or its alternative Ben and the linoleumed villa

Snatching it up she hurried away to her own room to enjoy the
excitement of reading it

On the threshold of that sanctuary she paused It was in a state of
upheaval There was no bedding on the bedstead no carpet on the floor
Instantly she remembered that her room was being cleaned for the
reception of Marjorie Whitefield and that she herself was to double
up with Aunt Maud during the period of invasion

Ashamed of her own feeling of acute distaste she turned and went slowly
along the passage

Aunt Maud was washing her hands for supper and the subdued kindness
with which she welcomed her niece and showed her how she had taken
things out of drawers and bestowed them as well as she could during the
girls absence made Olwen vexed at her own irritation

Aunt Maud was very fond of Ollie She turned wistfully to the only
young creature left remaining in the shabby old Vicarage She lingered
now to explain in detail every point in her successful packing of them
all in It was her part to superintend the housework while her elder
sister did the catering an arrangement which on the whole worked
well

Olwen strove with courage and some success to make her interest seem
real The way in which a certain hole in the diningroom carpet had
been triumphed over and the report that the reenamelling of the bath
was a complete success were things of deep importance to Aunt Maud and
it would have been brutal to snub her

When at last she went downstairs there were but five minutes before the
supper bell but curiosity would no longer be denied Olwen sat down on
the bed with the letter in her hand enjoying the delights of
speculation before opening it It was addressed in a very pretty hand
and bore the postmark of a part of England noted for fine scenery

Suppose thought Olwen whose suppositions leaned always to the
romantic that I hold my destiny in my hand at this moment

Excuse enough in all conscience for some dallying with the
anticipation

However at last the envelope was broken and the letter lay under her
eyes


Dulley Vicarage

Mrs Jones having seen Miss O Inness advt thinks the post she can
offer might be suitable She is in want of a lady to live in the house
and help in the training of her children five in number

A servant is kept but Miss I would be asked to make herself generally
useful Her secretarial training would be very useful to Mr Jones in
copying out his sermons and conducting his correspondence If Miss I
has a typewriter of her own Mrs Jones would have no objection to her
bringing it with her She would be treated in all respects as one of
the family and Mrs Jones would give a pound a month pocket money as
to her own daughter


For a moment Olwen gripped the letter in her young fist as if she wished
its writer were there instead Then her sense of humour triumphed
Bursting into hearty laughter she crushed the impertinence into a ball
and tossed it into the fender

Well she mused I think that is the limit And there is my sole
reply to an advertisement which cost me five shillings

Fiercely she brushed the thick mane of duncoloured hair that shaded to
gold And I thought my destiny lay in that envelope she whispered
quite fiercely Her eyes seemed to blaze They were pale grey eyes
made beautiful by noticeably fine lashes which with her eyebrows were
too dark for such fair hair She was not going to be discouraged She
would write to London to a firstclass agency and pay whatever fee
they demanded To go to London would be to escape from Ben

She laughed and sighed both at once Aunt Maud would have liked her to
marry Benpoor Aunt Maud who knew nothing of the discontent which had
grown up within the daughter of Madoc Innes She had feared it in
Ollies early girlhoodhad watched for signs of it But by degrees she
had reached the comforting conviction that Olwen inherited from her
Wilson relatives too good a strain of steady devotion to duty to be
troubled by her fathers vagabond instincts

She loved Olwen and confided in her Olwen loved her but never
reciprocated the confidences Aunt Maud might have inferred much from
the circumstance but she belonged to a type which does not draw
inferences




 CHAPTER III

 WHAT IS A PELE EXACTLY


Ollie has changed a good deal during these last three years remarked
Mrs Whitefield as she reclined in the least uncomfortable of the
Vicarage drawingroom chairs beside a huge and glowing fire such as
seldom burned in the littleused grate

Aunt Ada opposite was knitting with fingers knobby with rheumatism
We think we see a great likeness to poor Mamma in her at times she
remarked with that softening of the voice in which she always spoke of
her niece and which vaguely stirred Ethels resentment

Likeness to Mamma she repeated scornfully why she is as like Madoc
Innes as two peas in a pod See the way her eyes wrinkle when she
laughsand that mouthful of little short teethand the smallboned type
so Welsh you know When we took Lord Fishguards place in Glamorgan
last summer we were always meeting people who reminded me of Madoc And
she is just the same Yet she seems fairly steady you say

She is the best girl in the world put in Aunt Maud fervently Week
after week she hands over nearly half her earnings to Ada and me and
she gives every satisfaction at the bank You know Mrs Barnes only
took her post there because she was left a widow on very small means
She is a friend of the Otleys and she told them that Ollie is highly
thought of at the Palatine

Well it is to her credit that she should earn her living but in my
opinion a private post would be more suitable said the rich mans wife
reflectively Its not a nice thing for the family you know having
her in business in the very town where you residetrudging out to work
in all weathers I wonder if George could get her a better berth A
good many of our friends keep a private secretary and it is quite what
George calls a soft job

Though older than either of her maiden sisters Mrs Whitefield looked
years younger Her golden hair was not tinged with grey and her faint
suggestion of three chins suited her Juno type Aunt Ada with sparse
fading hair brushed flat pale face and spectacles might have been her
mother

It was the afternoon of Christmas Day and the young people were
upstairs planning a charade to be performed next evening The
Whitefield children had been born at what their mother described as easy
intervals Hugh and Marjorie were in their late teens Lionel fourteen
and the two youngest still young enough to be in the nursery

She is rather pretty you know went on the lady still considering
her niece Though I dont know that I admire any type so mixed Her
mothers hair and eyes with her fathers dark skin and eyelashes make
rather a curious effect Pity she cant marry poor girl but I dont
suppose thats likely

She might marry tomorrow if she liked as I happen to know burst out
Aunt Maud who could not bear to hear Ollie patronized

Indeed Anybody worth having was the somewhat surprised rejoinder

That depends on what you mean In my opinion not nearly good enough
for her but well enough off to marry and make her comfortable and his
family would welcome her with open arms

Bless me Then why does she go fagging on at the bank like this
Doesnt the young man object

She hasnt given him the right to object sighed Aunt Maud and I
dont think she will at least I should have said so a couple of days
ago but she told me yesterday that she is going out with himthat is
with his familythe day after tomorrow

Oh Mrs Whitefield was half interested half envious George and I
would give her a handsome present said she speaking as though this
fact if known should weigh heavy in the result I suppose I must be
pricking up my ears about Marjorie soon she added She hasnt
inherited the Wilson beauty but shell be worth picking up as George
says

So far as I have observed said Ada suddenly a girl needs only two
things in order to get married I dont mean a girl with money
Marjorie will get married in any case she needs no internal charm But
for a poor girl there are two essential things

And they are

A pair of fine eyes and an empty mind The fine eyes may now and then
be dispensed with but emptiness of mind is indispensable

Really Ada you mustnt talk like that even to me It sounds so
embittered It is sheer nonsense to say men like stupidity

Not stupidityemptiness A man wants a woman into whose vacant mind he
can pour the image of himself Jane Austen describes the pose as
intelligent ignorance but I dont think the intelligence matters much
so long as the ignorance is there

You are suggesting said Ethel superciliously that Clara and I had
vacant minds and that you and Maud are single because you were more
intelligent

Yes said Ada bluntly I think its true I was every bit as
handsome as you but George would never have married me because I had
ideas of my own So had Maud Ideas get in the way Life is far
easier for a woman who has none In that case almost any man will do

Which makes one afraid for Ollies happiness said Maud softly She
is just a mass of ideashas a really original mind

As she spoke voices were heard and Hugh Marjorie and Olwen entered
the room together Marjorie big and bouncing with the hockey stride
a purplish complexion and red patches where her eyebrows should have
been looked beside Olwen like a coloured supplement in an illustrated
paper beside a Cosway miniature

They came to obtain permission for Hugh and Marjorie to join the theatre
party next day

The Holroyds said Mrs Whitefield vaguely the people who spoke to
us after church this morning do you mean Ah yes Who are they Ada
All right

What do you mean by all right They are friends of ours

Well but you know how careful one has to be nowadays In our position
we must pick and choose I can tell you If you are in with one lot
you must be out with the other There are so many jumpedup common
rich folks about You should see some of the boys parents at Oakstone
the big public school in the Midlands where her boys were educated
rolling up in their motors all furs and diamonds and then hear them
talk Yet you have to conform to the standard they set Hugh used to
tell me he would rather I didnt go to Oakstone at all than come without
the car

There was a slight pause after this exposition of Mrs Whitefields
social views then Aunt Ada said incisively

The Holroyds are good people but they are nothing great sociallyjust
millowners like George

Ethels colour rose but she was not abashed How much money have
they thats the point said she Money talks Have they enough to
make people forget the mills George has you see

Olwen was shaken with a gust of contempt such as her father might have
felt She spoke swiftly Everyone forgets to be snobbish in talking
to Mrs Holroyd because she is sincere and generous and kind she
cried impetuously But if millowning is a thing to be forgotten
dont on any account let Hugh and Marjorie run the risk of
contamination The awful truth must be confessed the Holroyds dont
keep a car

Mrs Whitefield laughed sleepily as she gazed at her nieces heightened
colour She saw something unusual something compelling about Olwen
Married to a man with means she might go far

Why Ollie well take them on your recommendation I didnt know they
were intimate friends

Gracie is my best and oldest friend

And what about the son Is he too a diamond in a plain setting

There are four sons was the quick retort You saw the eldest this
morning

Her aunt smiled at the adroit evasion and said she had no objection to
the proposed expedition

When the young people had left the room there was a short silence among
the sisters Presently Mrs Whitefield remarked Well Maud judging
by that ebullition she means to have him doesnt she

Maud made a gesture of helplessness She ought to have a future said
she quite passionately only we are so helpless

And being in this bank is so against her No young man in a good
position hereabouts would marry a girl who as all his friends must
know is merely a bank clerk

Why dont you invite her to Mount Prospect for six months and give her
a chance Ethel asked Ada sharply

She wouldnt come was the placid response I cant picture Madoc
Inness daughter taking six months holiday to find herself a husband
can you

Its a case of these ideas Ada was talking of just now said Maud I
fear they will get in her matrimonial way poor child

And after all the men she would meet at your house are only Ben
Holroyd over again chimed in Ada who was really on the warpath that
day

Mrs Whitefield however prided herself upon making all allowance for
the inevitable souring of her maiden sisters I dont think I should
care in any case to make myself responsible for marrying that mans
daughter to any friend of mine said she quite goodtemperedly
Whats bred in the bone you know She might develop very undesirable
traits Think of poor Clara with her large fair beauty and this
little spitfire her fathers own daughter if ever a girl was

This was too true to be contradicted

Olwen awoke upon the day that followed Boxing Day with a feeling much
like that of Pippa on her holiday morning The world which had for the
past two days displayed closed shutters was now awake again and going
on its way as usual The mill hooters had rung at six everywhere the
toilers were thronging back to work once more Yet she still lay
luxuriously in half Aunt Mauds bed with a whole holiday before her
and a matine into the bargain

As she put on her prettiest blouse in honour of the days excursion
she heard the postmans knock and when she took her place at table a
letter in an unknown hand lay upon her plate Another reply to her
advertisement

Hugh and Marjorie were discussing the rival merits of two actresses who
were to appear that afternoon The vicar was behind his paper nobodys
eyes were upon her After the sharp disappointment of the other answer
she had no superstitious feeling about this one but she opened it
forthwith

The enclosure was in a slanting spidery hand and the address was
plainly stamped upon the top of the sheet


Guysewyke Pele
 Caryngston
 Northumberland

Miss O Innes Dear Madam

I have seen your advt in last weeks paper and write in case you may
not as yet have engaged yourself to tell you that I am in want of a
young lady as companion and secretary I live in a very remote spot
and am not as young as I was You would have no menial duties Your
salary would be 5 a month and I would pay your railway fares I
suppose you can give me references I am a widow my late husband was
first cousin to the present Lord Caryngston to whom I can refer you if
necessary

Should you think this suitable please come as soon as you can Even
should you not desire such a post as a permanency you might like to
come for two or three months until you find something else Would next
week be too soon

Faithfully yours
 CHARLOTTE GUYSE


Olwen looked doubtful as she laid the letter down To be companion to a
solitary elderly lady in the wilds of Northumberland was not at all what
she desired Her training would rust in such a place she would be
hopelessly bored There was a postscript to the letter which she did
not at first see since it was written overpage


There is a valuable library here which requires cataloguing


This modified her intentions The writer perhaps really only wanted
temporary assistance When the catalogue was complete she might be
able to come away again By that time she would have found out how she
liked the post She would not feel herself permanently cast away in the
wilds And it was a way out Until the offer of release lay before
her she had not realized how strong was her craving for some change

It sounded like what Mr Whitefield would call a soft job If she
found herself with a good deal of spare time it might be possible to
indulge her secret ambition which was to become a journalist like her
father If she could remain at the Pele for a twelvemonth which did
not sound impossible she might be able during that time to lay by
enough money to take her to London and give her a start

Breakfast was over before she had come out of her dream Shaking
herself free of fancies she ran off to help Aunt Maud with the beds
thrusting the letter out of sight for a while though her mind ran upon
the plan and played about the thought of the future

She started upon the days expedition with an odd feeling of
reinforcement against Ben He was no longer the sole alternative to the
bank There was a tertium quid should she decide to avail herself
thereof

Ben and Gracie awaited them with a simple eagerness which took no pains
to hide itself Mr Witherly the new curate proved to be the sixth
member of the party Ben had ordered a motor to take them to the
station and had not as Olwen had feared he might attired himself in a
frock coat He wore a lounge suit which she thought was new and looked
better than she had ever seen him

But it need not come to that Every time she caught the deprecating
glance of his uneasy eye she fortified herself with the assurance of the
existence of the tertium quid

Ben was well known on the line where he travelled daily to and fro
The guard was attentive they had an empty compartment and travelled
luxuriously first class a pleasure in itself to the young bank clerk

On reaching Leeds they went and lunched at the Caf Luxe to the
accompaniment of a good band Afterwards as they sat at coffee in the
lounge Ben as close as he dared sit to Olwen she asked him suddenly

Did you ever hear of a place in Northumberland called Caryngston

Yes its a small market town out on the moors miles from anywhere

No railway

Not to Caryngston You go on a branch line to a place called Picton
Bars I think It is between the Roman Wall and the Cheviots

It sounds remote Have you heard of a family thereabouts called
Guyse

Lord Carnygstons family name is Guyse I fancy there are several of
them in that part

Living at a place called Guysewyke Pele

Ive heard Guysewyke Pele spoken of several times It is supposed to be
the finest Pele remaining next to the one at Chipchase

What is a Pele exactly I thought it was a watchtower

Thats more or less right but it was a fortress too When the
borderers went raiding the women and children and cattle were driven
into the Pele and shut up there The ground floor was used as a stable
and the larger Peles had a well inside so that the inmates could hold
out for some time

Have you seen one

Yes Quite a small one though It is in the churchyard at
CorbridgeontheTyne The parson lived there in raiding times It is
quite interesting You like such things dont you

Love them I hate places like Leeds and Bramforth where the present
day has stamped out and obliterated every trace of former ages

But you wouldnt like to live in a very lonely place would you

She laughed I am trying to make up my mind

He went quite pale To make up your mind he stammered with such a
stricken look that her heart reproached her

Oh only an invitation to go and stay in those parts she replied
hurriedly I dont fancy I should like it for long

Ben said Gracie we ought to be on the move This thing begins at
halfpast two you know

They rose and went to find taxicabs




 CHAPTER IV

 HER FIRST OFFER


Ben was badly shaken

So long as Olwen was in Bramforth and he knew where she went and the
people who were her friends there did not seem to be so much need of
haste If she were going away however he had no intention of allowing
her to vanish from his sight without arriving at an understanding He
was not a quickwitted man Often as his beloved had sheered off
leading him away from the point he yet was not certain that this was
intentional Girls very often or so he was told did not know their
own minds until a man had actually spoken the fatal words

He meant that Miss Innes should hear them and he carried out his
purpose with a ruthlessness which left no room for evasion

The day at the theatre closed as according to Mrs Holroyds
programme with a supper at their house It was a merry noisy party
and after the meal Gracie took Hugh and Marjorie to the morning room to
hear the new gramophone Olwen and Ben remained in the drawingroom
and after a while Mrs Holroyd having been warned by her son melted
away leaving the two ttette The gramophone was playing Tales
from Hoffmann and Olwen feeling a little tired and dreamy leaned
back in a big chair looking very young and small Ben standing before
the mantelpiece asked her gravely whether she was thinking of leaving
the Baank

You would approve of such a course would you not she asked
mischievously

Ive never thought it suitable But what have you in mind instead

I have been there three years and I want a change said Olwen

Yes I daresay You are young I suppose you dont feel in any hurry
to settle down once for all

Settle down once for all Oh I could never do that

Never echoed Ben in a voice faint from astonishment

Im not domestic Ive told you so before I want to go all over the
world and try everything If I thought I had to spend my life in
Bramforth I should go crazy I believe

He was silent turning over this speech so subversive of all moral
order in his keen though narrow intelligence

Bramforths not much of a place he remarked Im not set on it
myself But a manor a woman if you come to thatmust stay in one
place if they have their living to earn

Oh no not at all I might be a newspaper correspondent and travel
from place to place Splendid fun to write ones experiences

Ben shook his head All thats beyond me When Ive been all day at
the Mills I like to come back to my own fireside and I should like the
same woman always there If she was there I shouldnt mind where the
house stood

Quite wonderful isnt it how different peoples ideals are said she
conversationally

Are ours different Perhaps not so much as you think He turned so
as to face her Miss Innes you cant have been unconscious of the
fact that I love you and want you for my wife

There was a simple directness in this which Olwen liked better than she
had ever liked anything in Ben before It reminded her of his mother
She grew crimson and gave a little gasp for she had not expected quite
such an onslaught

Oh her voice was horribly wobbly II have wondered ifit has seemed
sobut I thought it must be my fancy You see it was so unlikely we
are not suited to each other in the least

Likely or unlikely its true and it has been true for years I know
you pretty well and I dont agree that we arent suited Anyway I
have told you at last What are you going to say

She gave a sound like a sob Ben was leaning nearer Before she could
speak again he was on his knees his arms folded on the arm of her
chair What are you going to say darling he muttered huskily

She saw that she must be swift and definite I must say No she
uttered fear of some untimely demonstration on his part rushing in to
banish her nervousness I hate to seem so blunt but it is No and
when you have time to think it over you will see that I am right You
want a good affectionate girl who would love to sweep up the hearth
and bring your slippers and sit at home and do the mending And II
couldnt be happylike that No I couldnt Ben it is no use indeed
indeed You know I am sincere If I thought it possible that I could
ever settle down toto that I would tell you in a minute But I cant
I am Madoc Inness daughter one of the wild ones Im not a fireside
woman Im not the woman for you

He was silent for a long moment and his face changed sadly I had not
really very much hope he said at last but one never knows I was
determined that you should understand what I feel But I dont think
you quite realise that if you married me you would be far more your own
mistress than you are now You neednt live in Bramforth if you dont
like You neednt sweep up your own hearth or do your own mending I
could give you servants to do that You could travel Itit would be my
greatest happiness to let you do as you liked Ifif you could have
brought yourself You could make pretty well anything you chose out
of me

He broke off She had shaken her head slowly and miserably The
motion caused the ripples of her hair to shine like the tarnished gold
of an old Florentine frame It came to the mans mind that he had always
wanted so desperately to see that hair once more free as he used to see
it in her girlhood and that now he never would

Dear good Ben she was saying I like you too well to marry you and
make you unhappy ever after I have a devil in me I really have and
nothing would rouse it so completely as to find myself tied for life to
a man I did not love Oh Ben I hate I hate saying No to you
Please take it please dont make me say it again

He got to his feet drew out a handkerchief and passed it over his
agitated countenance I wont he then said firmly That is not at
present But I wont go so far as to say that I consider it quite all
over Theres no other man so far

Oh no no

Then as long as that is so I take it that you might change your
mind

She tried earnestly to prevent his indulging any such false hopes But
as the idea seemed to make it easier for him not to importune her
further she gave in after a while only uttering a fervent wish that he
might find just the right girl before long

A pang shot through her as she went to find her kind hostess and
timidly tell her that she thought they ought to be going Mrs Holroyd
looked from the girl to her son Her eyes filled her sweettempered
mouth quivered Olwens vivid fancy leapt up to picture what her
reception would have been had she given Ben the right to place her in
those kind arms How delighted they would all have been How
completely a daughter of the house she would have become With her
uncanny intuition she knew that she could have made herself just such a
woman as they all desiredhad she loved Ben she would have become such
an onehave lived her monotonous life and died her peaceful death among
the Holroyds and their kind with only an occasional pang  But she
was not fool enough to give way now though that picture also rose
before her minds eye She could conjure up Bens face should she
suddenly surrender could fancy him embracing her publicly before his
family herself strained to his stout form recipient of his kisses

Her involuntary shudder was the measure of her repugnance With an air
of shamefaced apology she took her leave feeling as she and her
cousins walked home that this had made it impossible for her to stay in
Bramforththat the Border Pele and the cataloguing of the library must
be her way out

Before she slept she wrote a letter to Mrs Guyse saying that the post
was not quite such as the advertiser had contemplated but that she was
not yet suited and would like further details She knew nothing of
nursing and could not take a post where she would have the care of an
invalid

She decided to say nothing to her aunts until she received a reply to
this and for two days she sat in the bank and worked her typewriter
feeling as if her life had suddenly become a dream She made jokes ate
surreptitious sweets cooked cocoa and chattered as usual Her whole
mind was meanwhile fixed upon the breaking of the news at home and the
handing in of her notice at the Palatine

Mrs Guyses reply was that her health was not very strong but that she
did not call herself an invalid and that in any case she had an old and
trusted servant who waited upon her She renewed her suggestion that
Miss Innes should come experimentally She was directed to travel by
train to Picton Bars whence Mrs Guyse would arrange that a fly should
bring her on to Caryngston at which place she would be met

The mere fact that the Pele was evidently difficult of access acted as a
lure to Olwen She choked she pined for adventure for wild country
for something as unlike Bramforth as could be had However elderly and
dull this Mrs Guyse she came of good family and must have some
friends who would be of the right kind

That evening she took her courage in her hands and broke the matter to
her aunts

Am I a beast she asked piteously I feel like a deserter leaving
you two who have made such sacrifices for me and going off But oh
my dears the world is so big and life is so short I simply must try
my wings I dont feel as if I could hold on here any longer

She spoke with her arms round Aunt Maud who said nothing but began to
cry quietly Aunt Ada made no pause in her endless knitting but turned
the heel of her sock before replying in a calm voice

Theres no need to apologise Ollie I approve of the idea and had
thoughts of suggesting that you should give up your daily work and seek
a resident post This does not seem quite what one would have chosen
but if it is clear that you go to see how you like it no great harm can
be done If you catalogue the books ably Mrs Guyse can give you a
good reference which will be more valuable in seeking another post than
any reference from the Palatine

Olwen sat incredulous Aunt Ada You really advise me to go

If you want to go I agree with everything that Ada says gulped Aunt
Maud but oh my darling I do hope it isnt because you are not
hhappybecause you want something you cant havebecause you ccare
for

I want heaps of things I cant have broke in her niece hastily I
want to go round the world and see its wonders I want to go and work
in London at the heart of things But most of all I think I want fresh
air I almost forget what the far horizon looks like Except for you
two and Gracie Holroyd theres not a creature in Bramforth that I shall
regret leaving I just want to be off

Then you will go quite soon

If I give in my notice tomorrow I could travel on the 8th or 9th I
shant want many grand clothes up there I suppose I wonder how one
does ones shopping in a place like that

The present Aunt Ethel gave you will come in useful said Aunt Maud
wiping her eyes and beginning to feel interested

Why so it will I never thought of that I am always inclined to
turn up my nose at Marjories castoffs but that motorcoat ought to be
the very thing for the Cheviots in January

Theres a difference observed Aunt Ada between castoffs and
outgrowns Its lucky for you that Marjorie is such a giantess She
only wore that coat about a dozen times her mother told me

They entered into all the intricacies of the girls wardrobe making
valuable suggestions as to various garments which could be done up
They were as eager as though she were their own child Aunt Maud
produced a bit of lace Aunt Ada an amethyst pendant The guilty
feeling began to fade away

Sincerely as Olwen was attached to these two her youth prevented her
from appreciating their wonderful unselfishness Impatience of their
limitations had often vexed her She had not insight to value their
renunciations

When Faber wrote his lines on unselfishness

 Oh could I live my whole life through for others
 With no ends of my own

he was probably unaware of the many educated women in England whose
daily life is a repetition of his formula Ada and Maud Wilson had no
ends of their own Their nearest relatives would have been astounded to
learn that they had any personal interests to turn them aside from their
quite obvious duty of running a household on insufficient means doing
their best to counteract the ill effects of an old mans parochial
neglect and showing hospitality to the various members of the family
who simply claimed it as a right Their fathers death would throw them
on the world practically unprovided for Nobody deplored this Nobody
tried to alter it Nobody gave it a thought

When their bestloved niece had run off to rummage in her drawers for a
couple of frocks to be looked over and have their claims to restoration
considered the two sisters fell silent

They did not look at one another for they were not demonstrative women
but they understood each other

There is nobody else in Bramforth said Ada as though in reply to
something said by Maud If she stays here she will marry Ben Holroyd
simply because she will find that she has to I feel the child is
made for better things

Maud gave a long sigh charged with the wasted regrets of her vanished
youth Oh Ada Was not that perhaps the mistake we made We
demanded more than we could get Are you so certain that she does not
like Ben You dont think she is going off because he has not spoken

I think she is going because the indirect pressure of her friendship
with his sister and the fact that there is nobody else is pushing
her replied Ada decisively

Maud said no more Her own tragedy had been the long waiting for the
beloved to speakthe vain waiting while other men came forward

She felt that whether Ben had spoken or whether he had not it was
best that Ollie should go away




 CHAPTER V

 TRAVELLERS JOY


The 8th of January dawned still and cold A black frost was on the
ground and in the sky the yellowish greyness which usually precedes a
heavy snowfall

It was however perfectly fine and dry at Bramforth when Olwen set out
upon her northward journey At Newcastle she had to change and later
on must change again for the little local line which would carry her to
Picton Bars

The lonely station stands high upon the fells and the snow had begun to
fall when she alighted upon the small dreary platform

A fly sent by Askwith landlord of the Seven Spears at Caryngston was
duly in waiting and when she and her baggage were safely bestowed they
started off up a hill so steep that the driver did not mount his box
until they had gone a mile and a half The Seven Spears was the curious
name of the hostelry to which Mrs Guyse in her last letter had directed
her new secretary with the information that at this point upon her
journey she would be met

By the time they had gained a wide exposed plateau the snow was
falling with surprising and increasing rapidity The great flakes were
like lumps of wool and the whole face of the country was white in half
an hour As they breasted the hill they encountered a keen icy wind
from the north against which the horses could make but slow progress
The train had been warmed but the interior of the fly was very chilly
It seemed to Olwen that in all the miles they travelled they never
passed a single human habitation How far they went she could not tell
but she was blue with cold and very hungry by the time they reached the
outskirts of a small town or a large village The grey stone cottages
were huddled in true Northumbrian fashion one against the other right
upon the road with no intervening garden plots as in southern counties
Owing to the storm nobody was in the streets and against all walls
which faced the north the snow had already drifted deeply Darkness was
closing in as they reached the market square white and empty in the
pitiless weather

Olwen felt a little nervous at the thought that the last and presumably
the wildest stage of her journey still lay before her She had hardly
realised that England contained a place so remote as Guysewyke

The inn stood on the north side of the square facing south A wooden
porch projected above the door and wooden benches were ranged below the
windows

As the horses stopped before the entrance a middleaged woman in felt
slippers drying her hands upon a large print apron came and stood in
the light of the doorway

Is it the yoong leddy for t Pele she asked in a hearty voice which
was strangely comfortable in the circumstances

Yes said Olwen as she jumped out eagerly Are you Mrs Askwith
What dreadful weather you have here It was quite fine at Bramforth
this morning

To think o that Coom away Missie and Saamll put trooks doon int
baack kitchen Theres a canny bit o snaw doon already and well have
moren enoof coom morrning Bad time o year to be travelling and you
sooch a bit lassie

The last words were tinged with wonder as Miss Innes walked into the
passage which was papered in imitation blocks of grey granite divided
into oblongs by bands of bright blue

Olwen laughed I think its funquite an adventure you know she
replied gaily Is there anybody here to meet me from Guysewyke

Ow ay there be said the hostess and as she spoke she pushed open a
door leading into the bar parlour whence issued loud laughter and a
whiff of mingled tobacco smoke leather gaiters beer sawdust and hot
humanity

Olwen caught sight of several men on benches three farmers round a
central table and the host in a green baize apron with a tankard in
each hand

The face of the farmer seated facing her was clearly visible for a few
momentsa long dark face with a pronounced chin a slight black
moustache and eyes as green as jade He seemed just to have said
something to amuse his companions and was himself smiling showing two
rows of teeth as perfect as those of an animal He looked she thought
like a picture of Der Freischtz the demon huntsman

In her hasty survey she saw nobody who looked like Mrs Guyses servant
but somebody must have been there for the landlady called out

Sheve coom Yoong lassve coom before banging the door and shutting
in the noise and warm odours

She turned to the other side of the central passage and ushered the girl
into a second parlour where a fire burned but dully Striking a
match the woman lit a paraffin lamp and disclosed the typical square
smallwindowed inn sittingroom with the usual rag hearthrug china
dogs on the mantelpiece stuffed gamecock in a glass case and corner
cupboard with treasures of old cut glass and lustre ware The panelled
walls had been painted in a vile yellowish imitation of the real oak
which the paint in all probability masked

Kneeling down with a pair of bellows the landlady quickly blew the
sluggish fire into a leaping blaze upon which she placed a huge log
Then rising and dusting her knees with one hand she looked doubtfully
at her guest

Yell no get to t Pele tonight loov said she not unkindly Its
drifting very hard oop on t fell already Muster Nin wont risk it in
the dark

Then in reply to Olwens Oh of consternation she added Well well
youll hear what he says himself

She paused and listened to a new burst of wild merriment which was
plainly audible from the bar Her lips twisted into an indulgent smile

Thats him Troost him to set em all off

Her eyes wandered to the somewhat forlorn little figure of Olwen who
doubtful as to whether she was to continue her travels or no was
standing by the table cold hungry and uncertain Bad time o year
for t Pele she remarked as if puzzled Soommers best oop
yander Her expression was odd and it seemed as if she was minded to
say more but instead she turned suddenly marched out into the passage
half opened the bar door and called loudly

Muster Nin Coom you here Didnt you hear me tell you yoong lassve
coom

All right Deb keep your hair on said a voice from within there was
the sound of a chair being pushed back and the young farmer with black
hair and green eyes emerged a pipe in his mouth a tumbler of hot drink
in his hand

His eyes and those of the stranger girl met momentarily and she was
conscious of two very distinct impressions first of his real though
suppressed anxiety to see her and secondly of his disappointment
She could not have explained how she knew this but in some way she
received the impression of his having expected something very different

Hallo he said looking her up and down as she stood in cold dignity
by the parlour table You Miss Inneseh Howdedo

She bowed You are

My names Guyse I drove down this morning to do some business in the
town and bring you back Didnt foresee this weather Afraid its no
use hoping to get to the Pele tonight What do you think Deb

Debs opinion quite frankly and decidedly was that it would be a
fools trick to attempt the journey Madam would never expect them

The Demon Huntsman pipe in mouth studied the silent girl with
halfshut eyes Think you can make her comfortable here Deb he
asked at length

Ow ay Muster Nin Ill be going oop now and kindle a fire in her
room What time would you like suppereh

Thats for the lady to say

You really think began Olwen summoning her courage that we had
better not try to go on You are not speaking on my account I am not
timid or nervous

He grinned Dessay not I am though

And you are sure that Mrs Guyse will understand and approve

Both Mrs Askwith and he were very sure of that

Then if I am to stay here might I beg for a cup of tea Im so cold
and hungry

Tea The good woman was overcome with remorse that she had not
thought of this Off she went to prepare it forthwith and Miss Innes
and the young man were left together

Slowly she laid down her muff and gloves unfastened Marjories motor
coat in which she had travelled and laid it aside disclosing her slim
little person in a dark blue suit Then she sat down in a big chair of
the kind known as a porters chair and held her stiff hands to the
comforting warmth of the fire

Her escort had moved round to the fireside and was sitting on a corner
of the table swinging one leg and smoking away with a total disregard
of her permission

His eyes were on her and after a while he took out his pipe and
chuckled displaying his clean white teeth Mean to say youve been a
bank clerk for three years he asked teasingly

Olwen almost jumped so much did this familiarity astonish her

Why not she countered stiffly

You look to me as if you were straight from boarding school as if you
had spent your days walking out in a crocodile with a mistress behind
to see that you didnt give the glad eye to anybody along the sea
front

Olwen was roused She must give this offensive young cad something to
remember You were never more mistaken in your life said she coolly
I am quite able to take care of myself and people are rarely rude to
me twice

Rude he laughed not the least abashed I should think not Fancy
cheeking a kitten at the age of six weeks

Your habits with regard to kittens or anyone else she snapped are
of no interest to me Pray dont let me keep you from
yourerassociates in the next room

He laughed out his head thrown back Fufffuff I do love to hear a
kitten swear

Olwen tilted her chin to a very haughty angle Mrs Guyse has provided
me with an unusual kind of escort she said May I ask who you are
Do you live near Guysewyke Pele

No I dont I live inside it Im the son of the house and I hope
you and I are going to have fine times together You looked such a
mouse that I thought you had no spunk in you but youve got a spirit of
your own all right all right

Olwen rose and gathered up her coat with the intention of asking Mrs
Askwith to let her see her room As she made for the door it was
opened by an applecheeked damsel who carried a teatray This she set
down upon the table giving young Guyse what he would have called the
glad eye as she did so

Hallo Flossie said he taking up his glass I drink to your very
good health You see before you Flossie no less a person than the
Queen of Sheba Make your very lowest courtesy Her Majesty is
travelling incog and Ive got into hot water by failing to recognise
her Look out for yourself my girl or youll get the setdown of your
life

Flossie began to titter and young Guyse rising said Tarta kitten
and walked back into the bar parlour As the door closed behind him
there sounded an outburst of laughter and Olwen wondered if it were
caused by some remark he had made about herself Her cheeks were warm
with indignation This creaturethis tavern witwas to be her house
mate at the Pele  Why Ben Holroyd was an aristocrat compared with
this

Mr Ninians full of his nonsense aint he said Flossie cheerfully
Known me from a baaby he has Me moother she says its a fair wonder
how he do keep up his spirits in that lonely plaace There Miss your
teas ready and should I carry your things oopstairs

Olwen sank down with relief to sip hot tea and eat excellent hot
teacake She was almost ready to cry at prospect before her but the
refreshment and the warmth revived her somewhat It was not yet twelve
hours since she left the Vicarage she could not yet accept defeat But
she felt uneasy

Mrs Guyse had made no mention of her son She had conveyed the
impression that she lived alone Was it wildly possible that her real
escort had been delayed by the snow and this unspeakable young man was
masquerading That might account for the merriment in the bar but it
seemed impossible that the Askwiths should be conniving at such a trick
Her gloomy meditations were broken into by the entrance of Deb who came
to know if she had enjoyed her tea She thanked her politely and asked
whether there were such a thing as a telegraph office within reach as
she was anxious to send a message to her people to explain that the
weather had delayed her

Mrs Askwith approved of this idea You caant tell you might be
snowed oop here and days before you get to t Pele was her
disquieting opinion Then not pausing to consult her guest she once
more pushed open the bar door and shouted for Muster Nin

She explained to him that the young lady wished to send a telegram and
he replied Thats easy enough if the snow hasnt broken down the
wires and I dont think it will have yet Advancing into the parlour
he peeped in a mocking devil in his eyes If your Majesty will
condescend to allow her slave to hold an umbrella over her we will at
once fare forth across the marketplace said he

He did not wait for a reply but took up her fur coat from the chair
where still it lay and held it for her to put on She was taken by
surprise and did so almost mechanically

Now Deb the big umbrella said he and I can manage so that this
midget shant be blown away

They emerged into the porch As the wind was behind the house they
were here comparatively in shelter and the snow seemed a mere
sprinkling Now said he as he set the umbrella firmly on his
shoulder so as to shield their backs cling to me for all youre worth
little un and Ill have you across in a brace of shakes

It was not a moment for standing on ones dignity The readiness with
which he had come from the warm room to do her a service mollified her
somewhat and she tucked her hand into his arm as directed

As soon as they were beyond the shelter of the house the blast drove
them on furiously She had the sensation of being attached to a live
wire so elastic yet so complete was young Guyses resistance to the
storm

Soon the snow was over their boots and she was jumping along in a
fashion which could not but provoke them both to mirth She was gasping
for breath when they reached the opposite side of the marketplace and
stood before the chemists shop which was also the post office The
chemist with a sack over his head was busy sweeping the drifts from
his doorstep The colour was high in Olwens cheeks and her eyes were
starry as she made a dash for the comparative light and warmth of the
shop within

The postmaster came to attend them read Olwens message slowly and
laboriously aloud and discussed the storm with great fluency in a
dialect which Olwen could only partly understand They discussed the
chance of getting to the Pele next day and Olwen found that her escort
had no intention at all of remaining weatherbound

This fall is going to stop soon after midnight he said the wind
will drop and then well have out Askwiths sleigh and go up there in
no time

On their return journey they met the wind and young Guyse thought it
better not to hoist the umbrella As the gust shrieked in their faces
the girl recalled the prosaic everyday aspect which the residential
district of Bramforth had worn that morning Everything grey
everything dull everything just as it always had been and always would
be  And now she was fighting the elements the icy blast from the
Cheviots like knives upon her face ankle deep in snow and clinging
close to a young ruffian whom an hour ago she had never seen

As they fought their way on the white surrounding expanse of snow was
broken by an approaching figure There was a moon behind the
snowclouds so that the night was not quite black and she could see
that it was a man in an oilskin coat and a cap with flaps tied down over
his ears who was moving towards them

Young Guyse evidently had no wish to encounter the traveller He flung
his arm round Olwen and turned her in a slightly different direction
His attempt at evasion was thwarted by a shout from the man

Hi Guyse Guyse Is that you

Guyse wheeled sulkily Hallo ungraciously what do you want

Have you got  knife in pocket  with hook for clearing horses
hoof

The speaker was out of breath but his voice was that of an educated
man Olwen saw that he had a short pointed fair beard to which the
moisture clung in drops

Her escort most reluctantly felt in his pockets and while he did so she
knew herself the object of keen scrutiny on the part of the other

Thanks Im sureas the knife was producedIm afraid I have kept
thiserlady standing What shall I do with the knife to return it

Leave it with Askwith I shall be at the Seven Spears till morning
With these words he dragged the girl away ignoring the others shout of
thanks and good night

Who was that cried Olwen in his ear

That The doctor Fellow called Balmayne Confounded busybody
Always spying

Spying

On me Why cant he mind his own business Out there in the snow just
to get a look at you I suppose

What nonsense

Like to have been introduced to you wouldnt he No fear

As he spoke they reached their haven the lee of the storm and she
heard his words clearly She disengaged herself from him no longer in
need of his support which he nevertheless seemed disinclined to
withdraw The doctor she thought might well have felt curious as to
who she wascareering across the marketplace with young Guyses arm
round her waist




 CHAPTER VI

 COMMENCING ACQUAINTANCE


Deb having as a matter of course laid supper for two in the now warm
and cosy parlour Olwen could not object Reflection showed it as hardly
possible that this egregious young man was anybody but the person he
claimed to be She had agreed to go to his mother for a month and she
could not well say I have decided not to come any further as I have
taken a strong dislike to your son

Thus no course was open to her but to endure his society and do her
poor best to mend his manners

On their return from the post she found a room upstairs had been
prepared for her and as there was a good fire there she did not go
down again until Flossie knocked at her door and said that supper was
ready

The parlour was empty when she entered it and she seated herself once
more in the porters chair to await her companion her feet extended to
the warmth of the woodfire

Her feet like the rest of her were small They were also perhaps
exceptionally slender She had her vanities like other girls of her
age and she could not help thinking they looked rather nice in their
buckled shoes as she turned them this way and that in the flickering
light The door being ajar she was unaware of the entrance of Mr Guyse
until she heard a chuckle and glancing up saw him close beside her
his black head sleek and silky like a seals his large hands red with
cold water She drew back her feet and straightened herself in the
chair with a caughtintheact haste which she instantly regretted
for his laughter increased as pointing to her feet he said in tones
of what was apparently meant for complimentary chaff

Now thats too bad You might have given me a minute longer before
ringing down the curtain Youre a hardhearted little midget

Your repeated allusions to my size begin to be irritating Mr Guyse
said she rising as she spoke and taking her place at table What is
there for supper It smells very good

Before we uncover tell me what youll drink Old Dans got some
tolerable port

Thanks I never take wine

Holy Moses Never take wine He mimicked her sedate accent Well
you are I should have thought Is it hot spirits and water then

Water please

Water please On a night like this Ill trouble you Comes of being
brought up in a vicarage

To that I plead guilty It had become a habit before I was old enough
to object

He flashed a look at her as of appreciation and uncovered the
rumpsteak Can your Majesty get her royal teeth into this

Indeed she can I really am like the Queen of Sheba in two respects
I have come from a far countryyou can hardly judge how remoteand I
have no more spirit left in me

Fate preserve me then when you are bucked up he grinned if this
is a specimen of one of your off days This will do you good Debs
steak and fried potatoes are not to be sneezed at even by travelling
royalties

She has provided spinach too said Olwen uncovering the dish Where
does she get that I wonder

Ah thats one of her secrets Theyre just nothing but turniptops
put through a sieve Good fake arent they

Excellent Quite an idea She began to put questions concerning the
Askwiths and the little town of Caryngston not caring in the least
whether or no the young man might be bored She thought he was for his
mind appeared to be elsewhere He seemed to wish not to be supposed to
be watching her yet the rays of his odd gemlike eyes met hers every
time she ventured a glance at him At last he burst out suddenly

You sent that wire to a parson called Wilson Hes not your father

No As you know my name is Innes He is my grandfather

Both parents dead

She hesitated then to avoid further questioning said Yes

So thats why you have to support yourself

I dont know I think I should have chosen to be independent in any
case

Hallo hallo A suffragette

If you mean a woman who wants a vote yes indeed

He was intensely amused The vote A shrimp like you Three of you
would go to one elector Oh gee I forgot No references to size
permitted But you know you look as if you were cut out for a mans
waistcoat pocket

She made a little sound of disgust Men are all alike said she in
scorn You are the second man who has told me that within a
fortnight

Oh indeed He looked oddly alert and angry She thought he gave the
impression of a dog who has pricked his ears I wonder who the other
fellow was

Your curiosity borders on impertinence sir

If thats the kind of little thing you throw off when youre on
halftime I wonder what will happen to me when the machine is running
full power What may I say What does one say to a girl if one maynt
chaff and one maynt pay compliments

You might try treating a girl like a rational human being for a change
and try how that works

Oh moonshine Mighty interesting youd find that Would you like to
know something about steers Or splitoak fencing Or rotation crops

I believe all those things might be interesting but I am bound to own
that as yet I know nothing about them We might talk of books perhaps

Books Were so likely to read the same kind arent we How about
Bennetts theory of chemical manures Eh Or would you prefer Plato for
a start

Plato with all my heart said she composedly Do you read him in the
original or translated

He looked up and laughed as if pleased that she had scored a point
Thats a good bluff he said with appreciation Youll get on you
will

But you dont answer my question Can you read Plato in Greek

No I cant

Then were quits I never got beyond Xenophon But I am rather keen on
Plato when translated Meanwhile for a change let me ask you one or
two questions Of whom does the family at the Pele consist Your mother
did not mention you She said she was a widow and I presumed that she
lived alone

She doesnt I live there too If youd known that you wouldnt have
come would you

No I shouldnt she answered simply and naturally and could see at
once that this was not the reply he had expected He leaned back in his
chair and stared without speaking

You might ring the bell she suggested With a start he rose and did
as she asked

When Deb appeared to change the plates he put his elbows on the table
and glanced up a mocking gleam under his lids Deb this young lady
knows all about Plato What dyou think of that

Plato Whats that Master Nin Some kind of a silver polish I
havent seen it advertised

His shout caused her to pause in the process of removing the dishes and
give him a smart slap across the shoulders You dare to laugh at me
said she beaming Oh youre a rascal if ever one was born in the
north Theres Shino and all these havering new fancies and I nobbut
thought Plato was another of em

Deb youre priceless I want to kiss you for that Hang it a man
must kiss somebody and Flossie says shes too old to be kissed any
more

Away with your nonsense Master Nin What do you suppose yoong lass
thinks of e said Deb somewhat tartly escaping with her tray while
Olwen with downturned lip sat silent in her place crumbling bread and
trying not to laugh The lamplight gilded those tendrils of hair so
dear to Benlike the bits that escape from the coif of a Ghirlandajo
Madonna It also accentuated the curves at the corners of her mouth
where a dimple lurked betrayingly

Deb brought back an applepie and a little brown ewer filled with thick
cream She placed the dish before Olwen who cut a piece for her
visvis in complete silence

No more questions to ask me he demanded at length His voice sounded
a little defiant as if he resented her unspoken disapproval

I dont think so yes perhaps I have Tell me something of your
mother What are her tastes her habits her opinions

She has none Absolutely none Thats why she ought to have a
companion You must tell her what to like what to do what to read
and so on Perhaps I had better warn you that you wont find her very
expansive She has no use for me which I dare say wont surprise you

A pause The polite protest for which he evidently waited did not come
What does she do all day asked Olwen after thought

Feeds her poultry Thats about all Theres another member of the
household of whom I ought to tell you somethingrather an important
personSunia my mothers ayah

Ayah Mrs Guyse has lived in India then

No as a matter of fact my mother never was in India My father had a
young sister who married and went out there She was left a widow very
young and came back to England bringing this woman with her I was a
child at the time and Sunia has been with us ever since becausewell
because she cant bear to part from me I believe Bum taste eh

This hint was no more successful in evoking a disclaimer than its
predecessors had been Olwen had revenge to take for his impudence and
she preserved a steady silence After a somewhat lengthy pause she
inquired

Am I the first companion that your mother has tried

He lowered his gaze which was fixed on her to his plate

No he said she had another Not recently though

He did not change colour but something in his voice sounded like
embarrassment She guessed with a quick leap of her mind to a
conclusion that her predecessor had probably welcomed the glad eye in
a manner she could not imitate and it was possible that complications
had ensued For herself she had no fears in this connection A very
few days would suffice to show the Demon Huntsman his place and most
probably her attractionhad he felt it which judging from his manner
seemed unlikelywould vanish when he found that in good earnest she
declined to be romped with flirted with or teased

Very soon after supper she excused herself on the plea of fatigue and
thought she detected relief in the alacrity with which he lighted her
bedroom candle and set open the door




 CHAPTER VII

 THE DARK TOWER


The morning broke with a clear sky proving that whatever his
shortcomings Ninian Guyse was a good weatherprophet Exactly what he
predicted had happened About midnight the wind dropped the snow
ceased and now the frost gripped the ground like iron and the village
lay surrounded by radiant whiteness reflecting the first sunbeam on its
crystalline surface

Flossie awoke Miss Innes just as day was breaking to say that Muster
Nin begged that she would be quick as he meant to drive her to the
Pele in Mr Askwiths sleigh as soon as they had breakfasted No heavy
luggage could be taken but that could be sent for as soon as the roads
permitted

There was an exhilaration in the air which made Olwen feel optimistic
in spite of the biting cold which nipped her as soon as she crept out
from the warmth of her bed Dressing with no unnecessary delay she
hastened down to the parlour whence came an appetising odour of
frizzled rashers

Young Guyse was standing before the fire apparently making himself
agreeable to Flossie in the way she understood while she set the teapot
and the dishes of hot cake on the table

He greeted Miss Innes with an odd mixture of bravado and nervousness as
though anxious to conciliate conscious that he had somehow failed to do
so yet in his heart convinced that the swaggering male attitude must be
the right one to adopt towards any young woman

Her greeting was as frosty as the morning and it seemed to depress him
for he sat down to table accepted his cup of tea from her in silence
and ate for some time without speaking

Sorry he remarked at length apropos of nothing sorry we didnt hit
it off better last night

Oh pray dont trouble what does it matter said she cheerfully

He frowned impatiently Weve got to live in the same house he
growled with a shake of the shoulders expressing the irritation of the
man wholly unaccustomed to snubs

Yes but I am to be your mothers companion not yours she returned
with a dry little smile

His green eyes had a resentful light Youve taken a regular grudge
against me I do believe he muttered and I only meant to rag you a
bit Women cant take a joke

You see women of my class are not accustomed to be ragged by
strangers she explained with a condescending kindness It seems that
you did not know that However as I understand you to be apologising
we will say no more about it

He stared at her more openly than he had done hithertoglared at her
might be nearer the truth The sun sent a shaft of light in at the
plantblocked window and showed her thick black brows and lashes and
their piquant contrast to her fair head If I hadnt your own word for
it that you are a bank clerk said he I should have taken you for a
schoolmarm Youve given me a bad mark Hadnt you better set me an
imposition I might write out Keep off the grass fifty times dont
you think

She smiled patiently Dont be absurd please but tell me how long it
ought to take us to reach the Pele

About two hourssnappishly Afraid you wont like it when you get
there

Im determined to like it if I can I hate to fail

So do I he flung back Im not used to it either

Indeed She could not resist the temptation to say that with an air
of innocent surprise considering him with an appraising glance that the
most conceited of men could not have thought flattering If I hadnt
your own word for it that you are a gentleman I should have taken you
for awell for something else she remarked and then as he started
and crimsoned she let her laughter have its way Whats sauce for the
goose is sauce for the gander sir she said

Suddenly he too laughed Thats one to you he conceded in a sort
of unwilling admiration Well I suppose its up to me to make you
revise your impressions isnt it

Impressions of you Oh why Im not sure that I have any she
replied briskly pushing back her chair and rising I must be off and
make ready for our start said she

This time he accepted the rebuff as final and made no answer Olwen
departed to make her arrangements as it seemed likely that she might
have to wait some days for the arrival of her trunk She went to the
back kitchen where her luggage was and asked Flossie to help her
unlock a box and take out a change of linen and an evening frock While
they were thus busy Deb came in and sent Flossie away saying that she
would help Miss Innes herself She provided a big cardboard box to hold
the extra things and while Olwen was packing them she said gruffly

You only coom for a visit oop t Pele loov or is there talk of your
biding there longer You may think I taake a liberty but tis no idle
curiosity in me

Olwen looked at the hardfeatured honest face and answered at once
explaining that she was on a months trial and was to stay on if she
suited

Deb listened gravely Im not one to make mischief said she and I
shouldnt open me mooth only I can see that you coom of a good home and
a good breed Theyre queer folk oop t Pele what with the nigger woman
and all Madam shes a poor creature and Muster Nins a bit wild as
you see Go careful loov and youll be all right but keep Muster Nin
in his plaace

Olwen was a little pale Thank you Mrs Askwith it is kind of you to
warn me I have to earn my living and I suppose I should find
drawbacks everywhere of some kind Thethe Guyses are all right are
they not There is nothing against them I meant

Mrs Askwiths No came after a slight hesitation She repeated it
after reflection No nothing against them They are of the old
gentry and near kin to his lordship poor though they be Youre not
to be thinkin over mooch of what Ive said loov Only go canny while
youre there If the Indian takes against you youll not be stopping
very long

Olwen sighed Im afraid Mr Guyse has taken against me as you say
already she replied and as she recalled Nins assertion of the ayahs
devotion to himself she thought she stood small chance of favour in
that direction Well she concluded it cant be helped I must try
and stay if I can You will laugh if you see me back here at the end of
my month

Or before said Deb with an admiring glance at the resolute little
face Youve got a home of your own loov she asked anxiously

Oh yes indeed I shall not stay if things are unpleasant was the
quick reply and the assurance seemed to console the good woman Nin
began to shout for Miss Innes and they had to break off talk and hasten
to the door where the sleigh stood waiting

Olwen took a cordial leave of the Askwiths who all assembled to see the
departure Just as she was being tucked warmly in under a fur robe Dr
Balmayne was seen crossing the square

Heres the doctor come to return your knife said she to young Guyse
who was taking his place beside her

Damn him said the young man quietly checking his horse unwillingly
as the other hurried up

Seen by daylight Balmayne was a goodlooking man youngish with keen
blue eyes and closely clipped fair beard He gave back the knife and
said a few words about the violence of the storm his eyes fixed with
interest upon the young lady in the motor veil of such a particularly
charming shade of blue As Ninian was evidently determined not to
introduce him he turned pointedly to her and addressed her direct
You will have a cold drive he said

She bowed and would have replied but Nin whipped up the horse and it
sprang forward Sorry cant stop Deloraine will take cold he cried
as they rushed off

Balmayne was left standing by the porch of the Seven Spears

Olwen sat silent her mouth a little compressed while they sped out of
the town and took a winding moorland road The snow was quite hard the
motion of sleighing which was new to her very pleasant The bare
heaving country rose grandly on all sides Caryngston disappeared
beneath them incredibly soon They were off together into the unknown
and her mind was working uneasily about the memory of Debs words of
caution

Presently her driver turned with a short laugh Another specimen of my
beastly manners eh Im not going to be pushed into introducing you to
that chap just because he comes cadging for it He can ask em at the
Seven Spears who you are and whats your business if hes so anxious to
know

She made no reply not knowing what to say

Too angry to speak he demanded pleasantly

Angrywhy should I be angry

Because I wouldnt introduce that chap to you

Whether or no you will introduce me to your friends must be a matter
for you and Mrs Guyse to decade It can have nothing to do with me

Tosh I do seem to have put you on your high horse

She was determined not to go on wrangling with him and she held her
tongue When at last she spoke after some interval it was to ask him
a question about the country they were passing through He pointed out
a few landmarks to her but without much interest and they drove mostly
in silence until they came in sight of a square stone tower standing up
on the skyline grey among the whiteness of the setting

Thats the Pele said ha Ever seen one before

Never but I have been told that Guysewyke is finethat there is only
one better along the border

Who told you that

Oh a friend at Bramforth

Well the difference between ours and everybody elses is that we live
in ours and nobody else does anything so lunatic Our reason is an
excellent one It is simply that we cant afford to live anywhere else
The Guyse who first built this had an eye to a military situation as
you will understand when we get closer

As they drew swiftly nearer it could be seen that they were also
approaching the westward edge of the high plateau across which they were
driving Beyond the Pele there seemed to be a drop of many hundred feet
in the level of the country and they went as though making straight for
the verge until they came on the very brink to a gateway with stone
sideposts of square roughhewn blocks surmounted by two panthers
holding the Guyse shield under their paws

Ninian checked his horse alighted and opened the gate They passed
through upon what seemed at first like a narrow bridge bordered on
either hand by a low parapet of stone with a precipice beneath on both
sides As he fastened the gate behind them Olwen looked about her and
could hardly believe her eyes

The whole western edge of the plateau they had just left was a steep
almost precipitous cliff A couple of hundred yards from its verge
there arose out of the valley below a small conical hill connected with
the high land behind only by a narrow natural causeway which was but
just wide enough to carry the approach Upon this isolated hill
forming an impregnable stronghold the Pele was perched No wonder that
it had withstood the onslaughts of the ages

The summit of the hill had been levelled and cut square Bound it like
a crown a quadrangular fortress wall had been built enclosing a
courtyard At the western end of the causeway where it met the
fortress wall was a small tower or gatehouse with an arch passing
beneath The gate was open one saw through into what was in
summertime a circumscribed bit of garden ground The Pele itself
occupied the northwestern quarter of the enclosure

Under the gatehouse arch a sturdy short man with the black hair high
cheekbones and small twinkling dark eyes of his Pictish origin was
busily shovelling away the drifts He had worked diligently and
succeeded in making the passage clear so that the sleigh with the lady
in it could enter the quadrangle

He greeted his master with an outburst of dialect too broad for the
stranger to understand Evidently some damage to property had been the
result of the storm for he pointed along the river valley above which
the stronghold towered His tidings seemed to vex Ninian

The girl was so occupied in observing the remarkable surroundings in
which she found herself that all anxiety concerning her own reception or
comfort faded from her mind Seen from within the fortress wall showed
itself as on two sides little more than a shell On the eastern side
where the gatehouse was there were still roofed and habitable quarters
in which as she learned later Ezra Baxter and his wife dwelt the
remainder serving as stables

The Baxters with the ayah formed the entire staff at Guysewyke
Against the western wall south of the Pele itself was a small stone
onestorey erection which had been built within the last fifty years as
a kitchen Along the south side were outhouses fenced off by a trellis
from the garden and here she guessed madam kept her fowls

Guyse who had been collecting her things while Ezra talked now turned
towards the tower All right he said to his man Ill come down
with you as soon as Ive had my dinner Come along Miss Innes

The low doorway of the Pele Tower was rudely arched Saxon fashion with
two long stones inclined towards each other at an angle like a V upside
down The door itself of grey oak with big black nails and iron ring
dated evidently from many centuries back Guyse pushed it open
shouting for Sunia at the top of his voice

Olwen found herself in a strange almost terrifying place

It was not unlike a cellar the walls being of huge ashlar blocks of
stone and the small windows deeply splayed within narrowing to
something not much larger than a loophole The roof was of stone
arched in what is known as a barrel vault Evidently in feudal times
the whole ground floor of the tower had been one chamber Now a screen
or wall of black oak panelling divided it in two the northern half
through which they had entered being a vestibule the inner half
partly visible through an open door seemed to be better lighted and
showed a glimpse of a table set for dinner

On the hall floor were thick rugs an iron stove though its effect was
not esthetic made the place pleasantly warm and there was a gateleg
table covered with an untidy collection of whips gloves
clothesbrushes and so on

There was a slight rattling of the curtains which covered the door by
which they had entered and a woman emerged without noise

She was small and withered and wore a dull crimson saree over her head
and draped about her shoulders Below it appeared a thick wadded jacket
and petticoat Her eyes were like clear deep coffee and her skin like
the same coffee with cream added

Sunia this is Miss Innes said the master of the house in a tone
which to Olwen suggested apology It was as though he said This is
allhardly worth the trouble of fetching How is my mother Ready to
see her he went on hurriedly

Madam well said a soft clear little voice She like see Missee
Eenis I take her up then you have your deener You hungry my
sahibeh

Hungry As a wolf Nearly ate Miss Innes on the way up Some storm
last nightwhat Bad enough in Caryngston Here Ezra tells me it was
prime Miss Innes wanted to come up last night in the dark but I
wasnt taking any risks

Poor Missee have a dreadful journey murmured the ayah her melting
eyes on Olwen who stood by the fire her foot held to the blaze You
come with meyes she said in the accents of one coaxing a shy child
Olwen met her gaze and smiled with a quick sensation of liking as she
followed her guide to the curtain by the door She found that the wall
was double and in its thickness a corkscrew stair twisted upward On
the next floor although passages branched right and left they did not
pause but ascended higher On the second floor they went a little way
along the narrow and icy cold stone passage and the ayah knocking
ushered her into a sittingroom It was quite small occupying only a
fourth of the floor space or being half as big as the vestibule A
goodsized casement window had been inserted the stone walls had been
plastered and hung with a light flowery paper Near the fireplace in
an armchair was seated a middleaged woman spare in figure with
faded fair hair and melancholy eyes She rose as the girl entered and
said with a little laugh of embarrassment Oh here you are How do
you do

Olwen responded as cordially as she could expressing her regret that
Mrs Guyse should have been put to the trouble and expense which the
delay at the inn involved There was no snow at all when I left home
said she or I would not have started

The snow is often very bad here said Mrs Guyse languidly Quite a
different climate We did not expect you to come on last night but I
hope Mrs Askwith made you comfortable and then you had my son to
cheer you up Very amusing isnt he

There was something peculiar in the tone in which this was said almost
as though Ninians mother were sneering Olwen replied quite
conventionally that Mr Guyse had been very kind She felt that her
answer was listened for not only by the lady but the ayah also but
neither seemed able to make much of it

Its dull for my son and me here in wintertime went on Mrs Guyse
I hope you will brighten us up

I want very much to be useful replied the girl and it will be a
pleasure to catalogue the library

To catalogue the library echoed the lady with an air of blank
surprise

You said that was one of the things you wished me to do began the
girl puzzled

Dear me yes of course My memory grows bad You dont look very big
or strong

Im not big but I think I am very strong For three years I have gone
to work in all weathers and only once in all that time been absent on
account of illness

Well we shall see In the meantime we had better have dinner as soon
as you are ready Ayah will show you your room

Up more stairs Missee said the Hindu softly On the top floor were
likewise four rooms but not exactly the same size This floor was
probably an addition to the more ancient lower part They came first to
a kind of landing or anteroom small but adequately lighted

Beyond was a larger room facing to the west and south and just now
full of sunshine The walls were not plastered but covered up to
within a couple of feet of the rafters with tapestry hangings above
which point the naked stone was visible

There was a black oak bedstead its canopy upheld by the four
evangelists quaintly carved Two or three oak chests stood round the
walls There was a small table with a still smaller mirror upon it and
a camp washingstand looked like a new importation The cold made the
girl flinch but she comforted herself with the thought that cold is a
thing to which one becomes accustomed In fact as she gazed around
her main preoccupation was the wonder as to how the articles of
furniture had been conveyed into the room up the twisting stair by which
she had ascended




 CHAPTER VIII

 THE FIRST DAY


The ayah who had set down the guests things closed the door behind
her without a sound As the girl removed her hat she was rapidly
opening the bag and taking from it such things as she needed Then
placing a chair before the tiny mirror she invited Olwen to be seated
with a mute gesture of obeisance

Hardly realising what was required of her the girl sat down Kneeling
before her her new attendant swiftly unlaced her thick boots and held
the little feet in her hands with a caressing touch as though she would
have chafed warmth into them

Too much cold she muttered relinquishing them as if unwillingly and
putting on the buckled shoes Then rising before the girl had
recovered from her astonishment she took a linen wrapper which hung
upon a chair passed it over the young ladys shoulders pulled out her
hairpins and let loose the rippling cascade of hair

You are very kind but please I dont expect you to wait on me I do
all these things for myself expostulated Olwen in some embarrassment

Missee let ole ayah brush her hairso long since me had pretty
memsahib to dress murmured the cooing voice The brush passed through
with a motion firm yet gentle it tingled as though there were
hypnotism in the touch It seemed to leave the mass burnished and
gleaming with a new beauty In a very few minutes all was deftly coiled
once more following the usual style in which its owner dressed it but
done twice as well as she could ever accomplish

Hot water was in readiness and having washed her hands the visitor
feeling strangely refreshed was ready to follow her silentfooted guide
down that weird winding stair When they reached the front door they
did not emerge into the hall but walked on in the thickness of the
wall to a small tapestryhung doorway which opened into the
diningroom

In this room two large windows had been cut one was semicircular and
set just under the arch of the barrel vault at the south end It was
too high to afford a view but the sun streamed down through it On the
west wall an oriel had been built out and this commanded a fine
prospect of the river valley below and the rising ground beyond

As Olwen entered she came upon the mother and son unawares and the last
words of what they were saying were clearly audible to her Mrs Guyse
had made some remark which ended with all the easier to manage and
Ninian before he realised the visitors presence replied with some
bitterness Im not so sure

As they became conscious of her they fell silent Nothing in the words
themselves but something in the silence suggested that they had been
talking of her

They sat down to table the ayah waiting upon them Under the high
window in the south wall was a hatch communicating with the adjacent
kitchen and through this the dishes were passed by Mrs Baxter The
food was abundant and very well cooked and served

Both the Guyses seemed distressed that their guest drank only water and
after cheese had been served Sunia reappeared with a tray of coffee
which seemed to be an innovation from the manner in which Mrs Guyse
received it

Do Missee good Missee must drink something lured the Hindu in
explanatory fashion

Olwen was prompt in polite protest but Ninian remarked that it was a
jolly good scheme and he couldnt think why they didnt always have it
When the ayah had left the room he said to his mother She seems to
have taken to Miss Innes

Yes A very good thing Shes so troublesome with her likes and
dislikes said Mrs Guyse peevishly She rose from the table and stood
in an irresolute fashion glancing first at Olwen then at her son with
much the expression a dog wears when he is wondering whether his master
will take him for a walk

What are you going to do Nin she asked

Got to go over to Lachamigg with Ezra The blizzard has broken down
the new fencing and well have all the ground game in after those young
trees

Oh Then you cant entertain Miss Innes She glanced vaguely at the
girl who stood by the oriel in the sunshine which turned her burnished
hair into a nimbus Madam cleared her throat Do you think you can
amuse yourself for a while Miss Innes I am going to have my afternoon
nap she said with a silly little laugh

O please dont study me in any way of course I dont want
entertaining Why Ive come here to be useful Let me make you
comfortable for your rest Do you lie down in this room

Oh no upstairs in my own boudoir I never sit down here in winter
Dont come up I would rather you did not I shall come down to tea at
five

Olwen begged so earnestly to be allowed to carry her book and shawl
upstairs that this was conceded At the door of her sittingroom
however the lady shut out her companion with decision and Olwen not
daring to face the arctic cold of her bedroom returned with reluctance
to the diningroom where Ninian still sat finishing his pipe

There was a shabby old sofa and two or three comfortable chairs by the
fire and on a sunny day such as this the room seemed eminently
habitable The girl went again to the western oriel and surveyed the
scene beneath her The tower stood on the sheer verge of the
precipitous hill but beneath this window there was a very narrow path
from which steps led downward The whole hillside was thickly covered
with trees and the tops of these snowladen appeared from above like
a mountain range in miniature Among the woods in the vale below there
was a wide stream now blocked with ice and snow but as she imagined
lovely in summertime

That is a river down there in the valley she asked after a time of
silent contemplation

It is a river So kind of you to throw the poor dog a boneI mean a
word

She glanced at the book in his hand Which is French for saying that I
interrupt your reading

He tossed the book aside rose and came to the window Thats the
Guyseburn It runs into the Irthing Its a badtempered stream the
one thing it will not stand is a bridge Ive tried several times to
make a way across just down below here but it was whisked away every
winter so I must wait until I can afford something different Lower
down where the cliff comes nearer the water we have got one of these
chain bridges which is safe but wobbly You wont like it much when
you first cross especially if the waters high

This is a wonderful place she said surveying the barrel vault more
like a cathedral crypt than a diningroom Have you always lived here

Oh no Only for the last ten years In my fathers day it was used
as a shootingbox but when he died I had to come here and farm the
little bit he had left us to keep the wolf from the door He was a rare
waster was my father but a very fine gentleman Would have suited you
first rate

Oh You think I like wasters

I feel sure you like fine gentlemen

Do you Well I dont know myself I never met one that I know of
My grandfather is very simple you might say Spartan in his habits My
uncle George Whitefield is a successful manufacturer loud and
pushing My own father was a Bohemiana waster too perhaps you would
call him but I loved him best of all

Rum that Fancy your liking a man who didnt consider appearances
You whose code is founded on prunes and prisms

Yes I suppose I am very conventional I am glad you have found it
out so soon she replied at once declining provocation

My father used to say he was the fulfilment of the old saying in this
country went on Ninian

 No Guyse
 Is ever wise
 Until he dies

Rather awful to be born with a name so easy to tack rhymes to How do
you like this

 Any Guyse
 With green eyes
 Will tell you lies


Instinctively she raised her look to his The strong sunlight was upon
both their faces emphasising her curious colouringthe warm skin too
dark for the hair and the heavy lashes She thought that his eyes were
like those of a leopard green and golden flashing an unspoken menace

I should think that rhyme is founded on fact she remarked

Thought youd say that The first time you have been obvious I will
admit that much Well I must be off or it will be dark by the time we
get to the farm Think you can live without me till five

Ill have a try Its a thing Ive often done before What time if
any does the post go out

If the drifts are not too deep the postman will arrive here tomorrow
morning about ten and he will take your letter back with him I hear
he couldnt get through this morning but we will hope for better luck
next time Anyway your folk wont be anxious You sent a message from
Caryngston didnt you

With these words he went out into the vestibule She heard him
whistling for his dog and presently the sound of the oak door banging

If what I wanted was change indeed it seems that I have found it was
her reflection as she sat down by the warm hearth

As she did not so far know where the library was and had no idea of
the sort of cataloguing required she felt unable to make any move in
the direction of commencing her new work Madam had definitely sent her
off duty until five and she had therefore no scruple in sitting down to
begin a letter to Aunt Ada She made this letter a good deal more
sanguine than her present frame of mind for she did not wish to let
them know how depressed she felt nor how out of place and forlorn She
dwelt upon the surprising nature of her situation from the architectural
standpoint the piquant experience of being weatherbound at the country
inn and her first experience of a sleigh drive

She wrote until the last red streak died in the western sky above the
thick woods across the Guyseburn Then she laid down her pen wondering
a little that she was not frightened at finding herself alone in this
vaulted chamber So wondering her eyes closed and she slipped into
dreamland only awakened by the entrance of a stout middleaged woman
carrying a lighted lamp

Eh but Ive woke ye up said she standing with her hands on her hips
and contemplating the small girl in the large chair

Nobbut a bairn so you are she went on but ayah says youre a real
beauty She looked critical as though her own judgment did not
endorse that of the Hindu Happen yere tired out after sooch a long
drive in t snaw she suggested

Olwen was tickled by the womans honesty and laughed out Perhaps I
am she admitted and you may be able to raise your opinion of my
looks after a while in this good air Im a townbred creature all
this wild moorland is like a fairy tale to me

Ah yell soon get your fill o that said Mrs Baxter calmly
Dooll thats what it is oop here Woon day joost t same as lasst
all the year roond

Why it doesnt snow all the year round surely I just long to see
this valley in summertime

Oo ay its fine soomertime I will say that replied the
northcountry woman taking a white cloth from a drawer and spreading it
on one end of the table As she laid tea she continued to talk
explaining that both she and her husband were born in that part of the
world and were used to solitude cold and monotony In return Olwen
told her of her own townlife and how she had never hitherto known what
it was to live without taxicabs telephones and typewriters

Just as the deeply interested Mrs Baxter had brought in the covered
dishes of hot cake and the silver teapot the front door was heard to
bang there was a sound of scraping and stamping feet and with a wild
scurry some big creature hurled itself against the door leading from the
hall which yielded and a golden collie bounced in rushed to the
hearth and stopped short at sight of a stranger there ensconced
backing with shoulders hunched and a threatening growl

Eh the brute cried Mrs Baxter catching him by the collar Muster
Nin heres Daffie showing his teeth at the yoong leddy

Nin from without shouted some abuse and the dog bounded back to his
master When they returned together soon after the man effected an
introduction made the dog shake a paw and instructed Olwen to bestow a
sweet cake upon him in token of alliance

Madam now appeared a shawl over her shoulders entering as Olwen had
done by way of the tapestry hangings

What conversation there was at tea turned upon the broken fencing Nin
said the ground was as hard as iron no repair was possible but Ezra
and he had done their best with some wire netting Madam had evidently
no conversation apparently no ideas Olwen remembered what her son had
said of her and felt a vague pity She herself made little effort to
talk but what she did say fell flat since the master of the house was
apparently tonguetied before his mother

Do you play billiards he suddenly asked

A very little The Whitefields have a table but I am much out of
practice

Not much reach said Nin with another scornful glance at her lack of
inches Well the one solitary thing that is good here is the billiard
table

A billiardroomhere cried Olwen hardly polite in her surprise

A billiardroom here he mimicked derisively Come upstairs and you
shall see Knocking the balls about helps to keep one from suicide
during the long winter nights

Only I dont play said Madam

Well I shant cut holes in your table I do just know how to hold a
cue said Olwen If you have a great deal of skill and patience you
may be able to teach me to play

Good notion Plenty of chance for flirtation in teaching a girl to
play billiards Shall have to allow you to stand on the table for your
long shots I should think said the young man with apparently no sense
of his own illbreeding

Olwen made no reply to this glancing at Madam to see how she took this
kind of language to her new companion upon the first evening

Nin nudged his mother Look at her She simply cant stand my cheek

I dont wonder rapped out his mother with sudden emphasis Why do
you behave so intolerably

Ninian looked somewhat taken aback Crushed again he said What
chance has one poor man against two ladies Daff come here and take my
part Shall I teach you to bite the nasty cross thingseh He
caressed the dog as it stood between his knees Sorry I introduced you
to the schoolmarm Daff She likes poodle dogs trained to walk on
their hind legs and show off Shes got no use for simple rustics like
you and mehave you Miss Innes

But perhaps rustics can be educated she suggested with a smile
unwilling to snub him too decidedly before his mother

Hallo with an instant change from bravado to soft insinuation Will
the schoolmarm undertake our education

That depends upon your wish to learn

I simply long to learn Ill be a model pupil When shall we begin
A lesson in manners after tea a lesson in deportment after supper a
lesson in charm before breakfast and

A lesson upon holding your tongue in between each I should think cut
in his mother suddenly and evidently to his surprise

The first lessons would have to be language lessons remarked Olwen
demurely I couldnt tell you anything until we could understand one
another At present we dont

Now what precisely do you mean by that sharply

She smiled provokingly I cant explain in words you would
understand

He turned himself round in his chair leaned his elbow on its back his
chin in his hand and stared fixedly

Its a deal he then said When does the first lesson come off

That she replied with a very small smile will depend upon what time
I have to spare after my other duties are all done




 CHAPTER IX

 INDIAN MAGIC


Upon entering her bedroom to change her dress for supper Miss Innes
found it bright with firelight On the bed her frock was laid out her
shoes were warming in the fender Upon the rug before the hearth the
red glow of the flames intensifying the colour of her crimson saree sat
the Indian woman crosslegged her chin supported on her hand gazing
intently at something on the ground near the fire There was a warm
seductive sweetness in the air like the faint breath of flowers

Olwen who had crept in with muscles drawn together to withstand the
biting cold felt as if she had entered a conservatory unawares

Oh what a lovely fire was her first impetuous cry Then
reprovingly You must not spoil me like this I came here to help you
not to make someone else to wait upon

The ayah raised her soft eyes to the expressive little face of the girl
who had knelt upon the hearth beside her Missee must be served she
said in her curious caressing voice I know it first minute I see
her The stars tell me Sunia know about stars she what you call
witch woman you sahibs

What girl of twoandtwenty is wholly destitute of curiosity concerning
veiled destiny Olwens eyes grew big What do you mean she asked
half laughing half in earnest by saying that the stars told you
things about me

The ayah rose to her feet with the lithe movement of a creature without
bones She held her hands to Olwen raised her to her feet and they
stood a moment eye to eye

Olwen felt her hands tingle

Missee make bargain with ole ayah Ole ayah never seen Missee never
know Missee all up to this night If she can tell Missee things gone
by things what happen to her long ago will Missee believe she know
what going to happen one day

There was something uncanny here The Celtic blood ran warm in Olwen
Her voice shook a little Sunia what can you know about me she
challenged smilingly

The little brown hands were softly impelling her so that she sank into
a well cushioned chair which stood beside the hearth The Hindu
crouched before her her face in darkness save when a wandering gleam
from the blazing logs caught her eyes and made them flicker

My missee born upon the fells she murmured Her folks carried her
southaway southbut she came back She born for the north she never
stay in London town She come north always north farther north where
she belong where she stay in her own place

There was a silence during which the girl held her breath her senses
lulled into a kind of stupor She noted for the first time that two
tiny earthen pots stood in the ashes of the hearth From one of these
ascended a minute twisting jet of smoke evidently the cause of the
subtle perfume which hung upon the air The vapour seemed to be binding
her senses in some kind of enchantment but the words already spoken by
the woman made her eager to hear more

Bending forward Sunia touched first one little pot then the other
with her tiny brown hand then sitting back on her heels she closed
her eyes holding her arms rigidly extended They were covered with
glass bangles and her movement caused these to ring or chime musically
The sound of them died away very graduallyas it seemed to the excited
imagination of the girl rhythmicallytill all was still The silence
was intense when the woman began to mutter

Two beside her when first she set her feet to earth  two who are
divided by all but their love for her Now one goes  driven away 
the one she love most  a man He look back all a time  but he go
And now the other she go too More slow Much more slow She is
alone She is very much alone I see her in a room with many others
 but quite alone always alone

The voice died away Olwen was agitated far beyond her expectations
It was as far as she could tell out of the question that this woman
could know the details of which she spoke She closed her eyes leaning
back in her chair and the soft chime of the bangles as the thin brown
arms sank upon their owners knees sounded like the last chord of some
dim fantasia

Have I seen true Missee

Yes Quite true Oh Sunia tell me more if you can see That one I
lovedthat one who went awayis he still living or is he dead

Dead was the soft answer Missee when I see her quite alone till
the north call and she have to come to the Pele Now look I take
Missee fartheronly a little I not see very plain this night because
we only begin When Missee give me her thoughts more I see better

Leaning forward she laid her hand again quite gently upon the little
earthen pots which had ceased to smoke So far as Olwen could see she
put nothing into them applying merely the tips of her fingers but at
once there ascended from each a thread of smoke very distinct
ascending spirally As the upward draught took them the two smokes
mingled and rose passing out of sight as if entwined

This one Missees that mine said the sorceress My fate and hers
have touched and come together Never come undone now Cant do Me
Missees woman always

As she spoke the smoke vanished the little pots contained only a
morsel of grey ash

Olwen did not speak for some long moments She sat fascinated
hypnotised by the perfume and the weird prophecy

After a while she rallied her senses and spoke with a desperate effort
to be normal That must be nonsense I have only come here for a
month Most likely at the end of that time I shall go away and you
and I will never meet again

We may have to part replied Sunia gravely I thought I saw a
parting and that is bad But not for long If you go you come back
again I very well can see that

You speak as if you were really a witch I think I am afraid of you

No need I only show you I Missees woman was the simple answer so
you let me do things for you I do everything for my Missee and that
make ole ayah very happy

As she spoke she arose went to the basin and poured hot water into
it

Arising with resolution Olwen passed her hand over her eyes as if to
clear away cobwebs It needed a real effort of willpower to wrench
herself back to everyday life Only the fear of being late for supper
this first evening enabled her to unfasten her serge frock and slip out
of it Sunia had lit more candles so that the room was now full of
light She stood a moment gazing approvingly at the rounded outlines
of the girls form Then making her sit down she folded a huge towel
about her brought the basin to a chair near and bathed face throat
and arms with water which like the air of the room was subtly
perfumed As she wiped the wet skin with the softest damask she
muttered that there was no time tonight to make Missee really
beautiful but later on she would massage her properly She let down
her hair once more and rearranged it this time with a trifling
difference of effect which was most becoming She changed shoes and
stockings and finally put on the simple little frock of dull green
velveteen

Wholly subdued by the womans spell whatever it was the girl made no
further objections As she submitted passively to her ministrations it
was with a feeling that all this had happened before that in some
previous incarnation she had been thus attended She did not rebel
even when the woman came to her holding in her hands a gauze scarf
curiously embroidered in dull gold

Cold down them stone steps Missee put this over her shoulders she
murmured

Oh what a lovely scarf

Belonged a Begum once Just right for my Missee said the woman
adjusting it over the girls shoulders The mirror was too small for
Olwen to see the full effect but the glimpse she did obtain was
satisfactory The gold of the scarf was the gold of her hair

I will wear this scarf if it pleases you she softly said Only you
know its yours not mine

All a same said the woman simply I just glad my Missee like it

As she spoke the big clock over the gatehouse tolled eight in its deep
sad tones The ayah collected the hotwater can and other things and
carried them off into the adjoining room

Is that where you sleep Sunia

Yes Missee You and me on this floor My Sahib he sleep next room
to Madam underneath

Olwen felt glad to know that she had someone near her although the
woman made her half afraid

Missee better go down said Sunia reappearing Take a light

She put a candle in a glass shade into the girls hand and turning
away with a last inhalation of the curious fragrance of her chamber
Miss Innes went down the twisting stair a little shakily feeling
overexcited and queer Yesterday seemed cut off from today by some
impassable barrier

As she reached the floor below her she came face to face with young
Guyse candle in hand obeying the supperbell like herself He stopped
short a startled look on his face which disappeared almost at once to
give place to his usual cocksure smile

I thought at first you were a fairy he said You are turned out
upon my word Determined not to leave me a single loophole of escape
arent you

Unfortunately you are not speaking my language I cant understand a
single word you say was the stiff retort

Ah that reminds me Ill have my first lesson after supper

Its very cold here Will you go first or shall I

Let me lead the way he replied turning on his heel

Madam awaited them in the diningroom She had made no change in her
attire Oh dear said she fretfully as Olwen came in you have
made yourself smart

Olwen laughed glad to expend some of her bottledup excitement

This is Sunias doing the scarf is hers She begged me to put it on
I thought it was her pretty way of telling me that my frock was a bit
shabby for the occasion so I did as she asked

Well you look very nice I must own You pay for dressing as they
say It is years since I have seen anybody prettily dressed

Ninian made a restless movement

In my husbands lifetime we had a house in town as well as a big
country place went on his mother Ninian doesnt realise at all how
much I miss it

Her son was very red Mother what is the use of talking so You know
I cant help it

Madam sighed deeply but as the ayah now entered with a silver entre
dish in her hand they sat down to table and the subject dropped It
had one good effect for it made Ninian exert himself to talk so as to
turn the current of Madams thoughts Olwen was grateful to him for
making conversation for her own fancy was so full of the
fortunetelling as to make it impossible for her to fix her thoughts on
anything else Later when the ayah had left the room she could no
longer resist speaking of what had occurred Is not your Sunia a
clairvoyante she asked She has been saying most extraordinary
things to me

Madam stared in faint surprise What kind of things

About my childhood and early life Things she could not possibly have
known She spoke of my parents divided in everything but their love
for me That is unfortunately true but she could not have known it
by any ordinary means

As she spoke she caught Mr Guyses eye There was an expression in it
which held her attention but which she could not analyse It was
rather like pity As their eyes met he rose from table with a nervous
laugh Shes an old humbug he said Dont listen to her dont let
her bore you Shall I tell her to let you alone

Oh please dont tell tales of me She has been so kind she has done
all she could for me II didnt mind her saying that only it seemed a
bit uncanny

He gave her another selfconscious look then turned away and lit his
pipe without replying

Lets go to the billiardroom he said at length Come along Ma

Mrs Guyse rose with evident unwillingness and began to look for her
shawl Olwen found it and put it over her shoulders The room will
be as cold as a well said she fretfully Understand Nin that I go
off to bed in an hours time

All right replied her son shortly

They mounted to the floor immediately above and the puzzle as to where
they kept the library was solved This great apartment had evidently
been the refectory or banqueting hall It had been altered into a
library by the Tudor Guyse who had cut windows so recklessly and
Madams dead husband had turned it into a billiardroom

It covered the whole floor space of the tower except for a small bit at
the north end On this side were three arched doors enriched with
ballflower moulding the easternmost leading to the chapel the western
to the priests room the central one to a small windowless space known
as the dungeon

Above the fine bookcases was oak panelling on which hung a few inferior
oil paintings of dead Guyses

Near the south end of the west wall was a very large oriel with a
window seat and table and chairs So large was the apartment that the
fullsized billiard table looked quite small in it and left plenty of
space for settles and armchairs round about the Tudor fireplace with
the Guyse arms carved above

The existence of this noble room delighted Olwen It changed the whole
character of the place Here was an ideal spot for reading or writing
There were several fine screens in stamped leather which would exclude
draughts The western oriel commanding a view of the lovely Guyseburn
Dale would be utterly delightful in summertime

Ninian seemed pleased at her nave admiration He displayed to her the
poor bare little chapel destitute of all plenishing and the two other
apartments Olwen wondered how the priest could close his eyes at
night if there were a prisoner in solitary confinement next door to
him Young Guyse laughed and said that the Border folk priests and
laity alike were a hardbitten lot and that in those days compassion
was hardly counted as a virtue It was as badly out of fashion as
discipline and obedience are now

I must own that I believe my ancestors to have been a set of
bloodyminded thieves he remarked with candour

Theyre but little changed now observed his mother from her seat by
the fire

Thanks Ma dont lose a chance he flung back negligently going to
the rack to choose cues

He found that Olwen had somewhat underrated her own skill He gave her
a big handicap and she actually beat him Mrs Guyse who at first sat
languidly reading the paper presently sat up and at last even left her
place to watch them They all three became quite animated and when
Madam suddenly recollected herself and said she was going to bed at
once it was more than halfpast ten

Olwen though the game was not finished put away her own cue and began
to collect the ladys workbag and cushions

Oh stay and finish your game Dont let Ninian be able to say that I
took you off before the end said the hostess pettishly

But please I am very tired said Olwen I am quite ready to say good
night

She said it with so much firmness that Ninian who had flung down his
cue and marched upon her with the evident intention of sharp protest
said not a single word but allowed them both to disappear through the
narrow door with a candle to guide the steps of Madam on the dark
stairs

When they reached the ladys own quarters the girl followed her into
the sittingroom and setting down the candle asked modestly for a few
directions

Im very anxious of course to do exactly as you wish said she At
what hour is breakfast and should you expect me to make the tea or
coffee

Madam stood irresolutely by the table twisting her hands together as if
worried almost beyond endurance Her face was set in obstinate lines
To come down to breakfast I absolutely decline said she in a
desperate voice I havent done such a thing for years and it cant
be expected of me

Olwen was so astonished that she stood with her mouth open

I suppose you have no objection to breakfasting with my son You seem
to be extremely particular said Madam after a pause

I am here to carry out your orders was the girls reply I shall do
as you wish of course At what hour does Mr Guyse breakfast

At eight oclock

And you would like me to be down and to breakfast with him

He would was the surprising answer

Olwen shrugged her shoulders Then she went on as steadily as she
could at what time should I come to you Is there anything you would
like me to do or shall I begin at once upon the library books

With a weary gesture the lady dropped into a chair

Really Miss Innes I cannot be bothered like this I am tiredI wish
to sleep Go to bed for goodness sake and when I am up tomorrow
perhaps I shall have some orders for you I am usually dressed about
eleven

Thank you was the meek response That was all I wanted to know I
am sorry to be importunate but I feel a little strange at first

Yes yes I know Good night I hope you will be comfortable Sunia
says your bed is soft but comfort in this jail of a place seems a thing
one cant even imagine She turned with a harsh laugh upon the girl
as she withdrew When I married Ninians father I had never put on my
own stockings in my life I was a millionaires daughter And nowlook
at me Look at my house Look at my clothes Even the sight of a girl
from a town upsets me




 CHAPTER X

 A QUEER HOUSEHOLD


Extract from a letter to Miss Grace Holroyd dated January 12


Since the first scrawl I sent you telling you of my safe though
delayed arrival and trying to describe this extraordinary place I
have begun two letters and torn up both in despair The truth is that
ever since I got here my mind has been rushing round and round mixing
and curdling itself more like milk in a churn than anything I can think
of This is Friday I arrived here on Tuesday and I find myself just
as bewildered just as unable to give such an account of my environment
as may sound sane and well considered as I was the first day

I was always conscious of living at Bramforth in too deep a groove
but little did I guess how far I was sunk therein or how hard would be
the process of readjustment

Having written that down I pause to wonder whether it is true Was my
groove so deep or is the eccentricity of the Guyses to blame for my
mental confusion Sometimes I incline to one view sometimes to the
other but I am beginning to feel quite sure that strange as this
Peleplace is the trio of persons who dwell therein are far far more
improbable

First there is the Indian ayah striking so bizarre a note of contrast
to begin with that it makes one quite giddy She is the only one who
took to me from the first Judging from what I hear she is by no means
agreeable to everybody so I ought to consider myself lucky I suppose

Her affection takes the form of waiting upon me hand and foot One
would fancy she had been languishing in a far country for years buoyed
up solely by the hope of being one day permitted to lace my boots
Picture me Gracie after such a youth as you know of hardly allowed so
much as to wash my own hands I lie now under a carven canopy in a
nest of down so thoroughly warmed for me at night that I sleep a kind of
charmed slumber from dusk to dawn When I awake it is to find my
handmaid at my side with teasuch teaand creamsuch cream While I
sip in luxury she rekindles the fire which usually has not quite gone
out all night so cunningly does she bank it down

In front of this fire she prepares my bath andnow I beg of you not to
blushshe insists upon bathing me herself rubbing me from head to foot
with a kind of wondrous massage She then dresses my hair and I go
down to breakfast all in a glow ready for anything even the Guyse
mnage

I remember hearing your dear wise mother say that if you give your
household staff thoroughly comfortable quarters and plenty of good food
they would never grumble at work however hard Perhaps that is Sunias
idea about me I am indeed well fed and lodged

I breakfast alone with the young man of whom I told youthe one who
brought me here He goes off to work on his farm immediately after He
works very hard I think for he has only Ezra Baxter a man named Kay
and one or two farm labourers to help him

At about eleven oclock Madam as Mrs Guyse is called by everyone in
the house makes her appearance When we reach her we are at the
thickest of the mystery I cannot understand her one bit She is not
merely in no want of a companion she even seems quite unmistakably to
be bored by my presence to look upon me as an incubus for whom
occupation or amusement must somehow be found

Is it not quaint She wrote to me herself she offered me unusually
high terms she was apparently most anxious for me to come at once Now
that I am here she does not in the least know what to do with me I
have to make work for her main idea seems to be to contrive how little
of my company she need endure to plan reasons for keeping me out of her
sight

The idea of her having a companion came I suppose from her son
Sometimes I think he suggested it merely to give him somebody to tease
One could hardly blame him a winter here must be an ordeal There is
however another possible reason I have guessed that he fears the
isolation here is telling upon Madams mental faculties and that she
must be taken out of herself even if she doesnt like the remedy They
were apparently very rich in former days and the poor ladys fallen
fortunes have no doubt preyed upon her mind

I cant flatter myself that I have made much headway yet So far I
have merely made a preliminary examination of the library which while
anything but up to date seems valuable and contains what even my
ignorance knows to be rare editions

Let me give you an example of my difficulties

The day after my arrival Mr Guyse suggested a sleigh drive I
assented supposing of course that Madam would go too I found
however when the time came that she had not the least intention of so
doing I therefore excused myself pointing out to the young man that I
could not go out and leave her alone the whole afternoon Upon this to
my surprise Madam lost her temper turned to me and asked what use I
should be if I could not do as I was told She expected me to take her
place and accompany her son when she could not She never went out when
the snow was on the ground Of course I felt ashamed of having made a
fuss and I went obediently but neither of us enjoyed it He and I do
not get on a bit His idea of making himself agreeable is either to
chaff or to flirt and I hate both This obliges me to be so grim and
stony when I am with him that you would think I had never unbent in my
life I have the uncomfortable feeling that if I so much as smile
frankly at him he will take advantage of it to make some personal
remark about my dimple or some such folly Well to continue I suppose
that he brought some kind of pressure to bear upon his mother after that
drive for the following day she said she was coming with us and come
she did Alas My triumph was shortlived Nemesis has overtaken me
She promptly took cold and this morning we decided to send for the
doctor Young Guyse has some grudge against the doctor so the matter
has not endeared me in that quarter as you may imagine However as I
prefer him out of temper that doesnt matter much

SaturdayIf I had dispatched this yesterday it would have ended with
an emphatic declaration that I meant to look out for another post at
once Last night however something happened to shake my resolution

As poor Madam was too seedy to come downstairs I went up to her after
supper to see if I could do anything to amuse her She had already
informed me that if there is one thing she dislikes more than another it
is having anyone read aloud to her So I took my little patience cards
You know a long experience with grandfather has made me quite a
compendium of Barnes

I had noticed a green baize writingboard down in the billiardroom
and I succeeded in arranging this across the arms of her chair so that
she could handle the cards conveniently We started with an easy game
and before we had been going ten minutes I knew I had lighted upon
something that took her fancy

She grew quite interested displaying a childish eagerness Then just
as she was beginning to chatter to me more naturally than she has ever
done that hateful young man must needs come pounding on the door to
know if I wasnt coming down to play billiards with him

He marched innobody can shout through these oaken doorsand I saw her
expression change and a nervous look creep into her face as it does
when she sees him You had better go she said uncertainly

It came to me all in a minute that she needed a champion and I got up
and went to him saying decidedly that I could not go as he must see
for we were in the middle of a most interesting game

Oh tosh he said easily come along Ive had the room warmed on
purpose for you

Im sorry you took the trouble I replied but surely you understand
that when your mother wants me I must be with her

She was making little anxious sounds and coughing significantly Go
with him I can spare you quite well she muttered but my blood was
up I went to the door and he thinking he had gained his point
followed me out into the passage or rather the tunnel He had a candle
in his hand so he could see my face

Mr Guyse I said when you brought me here you told me that your
mother was badly in need of distractionthat she suffered from ennui
Now that I have watched her for several days I am sure that you did a
right and necessary thing in persuading her to have somebody to live
with her She leads too solitary an existence and it is telling on her
health and spirits Tonight for the first time she has seemed glad
of my company and interested in what we are doing You couldnt be so
selfish as to want me to leave her to herself

He flushed angrily And what price me Is it good for me to be
everlastingly alone he began and then quite suddenly he broke off and
grinned at me as if it were a huge joke

Right as usual teacher he said Yes its true I knew she ought
to have somebody about You go right on and never mind me

I was quite astonished and a little touched I felt you were only
thoughtless I said He remarked that I was evidently born to be the
mistress of a reformatory but he evidently bore no malice and cleared
off without further ado As I went back I thought over the speech I had
made and it did sound horribly priggish I never spoke so to anybody
before Isnt it astonishing how different one is with different
people I dont think I ever struck you as a sanctimonious little
hypocrite did I Gracie my beloved

Madam looked so surprised when I came back that I could not help
laughing a little as I sat down by her

Please Miss Innes said she faintly go down and have a game with
poor Nin he is so lonely

He may be lonely there but you are lonely here said I Was I
engaged to look after him or you

Hell be very angry she began but I assured her that he was
notthat he had said he thought me quite right

Oh he may not show it to you but it is I who will hear of this
again said she

Nothing of the kind I said Ill see to it that he shant tease
you Rather cheek on my part He doesnt mean to be unkind but
men are inconsiderate If I explain matters to him he will be more
reasonable

She looked unhappy and undecided and then said in a kind of burst I
am so anxious for you and him to get on together I dont want you to
go away

Well that was putting things in a new light Apparently she thinks
that if I dont make myself agreeable to the master of the house he will
tell her to give me notice The thought made me quite angry The
ingenuous speech had also shown me something else I had not supposed
that Madam liked me and her unconscious admission bucked me to a
surprising extent

Then you dont want me to go away I asked and she replied
hurriedly No indeed I am most anxious very anxious that you
should stay

     

So that was settled and just for the moment I mean to stay and to keep
up if I can my new role of mistress of a reformatory I worked it
splendidly at breakfast and was able to refuse a sleigh drive on the
plea that I must not be out when the doctor calls In spite of his rage
that this said doctor who is young and goodlooking should be coming
at all Mr Guyse was fain to admit that this was a just excuse He
looked at me curiously as if in wonder that anyone so severely proper
as I could contrive to exist

So far so good The difficulty will be to keep it up if we see much
of each other for he is madly provoking and as you know I have a
tongue

Well I must end this rigmarole and go and brush my hair in
preparation for receiving Dr Balmayne whose impending arrival is
exciting me to an extent that I cannot expect you to understand until
you have lived the best part of a week in a dark tower cut off from all
intercourse with the world outside

You see we met the doctor on our way up here and I thought he looked
interesting He stared at me as if he thought I was not quite proper
and seeing what young Guyse is I can hardly wonder However I hope
to persuade him of my moral rectitude and also perhaps of my rare
personal charm this afternoon Best love and farewellYour chumgirl
OLWEN




 CHAPTER XI

 MISS LILY MARTIN


The sight of Dr Balmaynes little runabout car creeping slowly along
the snowy road across the moor was indeed in the nature of an event
From Tuesday until Saturday only a few farm carts had dared the track
The doctor stopped at the outer gateway crossing the causeway on foot
so his approach was not visible from the Pele itself Olwen had
however been out to feed the chickens their mistress being actually in
her bed and Mrs Baxter ran into the courtyard in some excitement to
announce the arrival descried by herself from the vantage ground of the
Gatehouse

Mr Guyse being out Olwen had no hesitation in going to the archway to
greet the doctor She stood in fur cap and big coat smiling and rosy
under the fangs of the rusty portcullis

Well said Balmayne drawing off his glove to greet her so you are
still alive

She laughed gaily Did you expect to see my head fixed upon a spike
outside the battlements she inquired No I find Castle Terribil
strange enough but possible

Good he answered Strange but possible You seem to have a fine
taste in adjectives

I have felt like ransacking a dictionary for them since I came here
whenever I am wrestling with the difficulty of conveying to my wholly
Philistine relations anything like the impression this place produces

He stopped midway as they strolled across the quadrangle gazing up at
the almost unbroken wall of the Pele grim and grey on that side
pierced only by the loopholes which lighted the newel stair

Its still fine you know he said half grudgingly When it was first
built it possessed of course the supreme attribute of
architecturethat of complete fitness for its intended purpose But
even now that this is so no morenow that it is no praise of a dwelling
that it shall also be a fortressit is still wonderful still
dignified

Like some people one knows it turns its most forbidding face to the
approaching stranger she replied On the other side where it
overlooks the valley the Tudor Guyses opened out windows quite
recklessly

They had no hesitation in adapting it to their needs We are afraid to
do that now the spell of the past is too strong for us

Humph Somebody or other not so many generations back perpetrated
that observed the girl pointing the finger of scorn to the low ugly
kitchen huddled against the south wall its chimney sulkily asmoke

He laughed Well thats not encouraging I own And so you are
finding existence possible

I am having an experience was her reply and I was rather in search
of that However it is early days yet I suppose the snow doesnt
lie all the year round even here As regards Mrs Guyse I fear her
bad cold IB my fault I urged her to go for a sleigh drive and she is
so unused to fresh air that it gave her cold so I am feeling rather a
failure just at present

Your theory was right but in practice it went back on you he replied
amused A thing which does sometimes happen even in these anything
but tropical climes

When a vessel is so to speak snarked she concluded Yes you have
helped me to a word Mrs Guyse is so to speak snarked Really she
is a good deal like the Bellman in being courteous and grave but the
orders she gave are enough to bewilder a crewoh Im talking nonsense
but really it is such a queer household The poor lady resented my
coming but as a fact she is in sad need of a companion

Yes he replied reflectively laying his hat and gloves on the hall
table for they had entered the Pele while they talked but her last
experience in that direction was a bit shattering wasnt it

She gave a startled glance Was it I didnt know Tell me

He coloured slightly I beg your pardon I thought you might have
been told something of it by this time However as the Guyses have said
nothing I have no business to be discussing their affairs

Certainly you are right but she said it reluctantly She had the
idea that this man might supply her with a clue tell her something
which might form a key to the characters of the strange people among
whom she found herself

Will you wait a moment while I let Mrs Guyse know she said and
vanished from his sight behind the curtain which hid the stairfoot

When she returned he stood with his back to the stove contemplating
the barrel vault It was never anything like full daylight in the
vestibule owing to the primitive nature of the fenestration

Have you seen the well yet he asked

No she replied with vivid interest Where is it

Almost under your feet where you stand Get Guyse to show you Its
beautiful water and was the sole source of supply until they came to
settle here ten years ago when he brought water up the hillside into
the courtyard

What a place she laughed

Have you ever thought to wonder how they conveyed any furniture to the
upper floors

I did but never made inquiries Now one thinks of it how could they
have got a billiardtable in

Pulled out all the mullions of the big south window and hauled the
table up with ropes outside the wall That was Ninians father all
over

They must have done the same thing all over the house

I believe they did except for such things as had been carried up in
pieces and put together on the spot You know in the old times when
there was raiding on the border the cattle were all driven in here
where we stand the women and children being accommodated above
Sometimes there were too many beasts for this place and on one
occasion at least some of them were stabled in the Gatehouse with the
garrisonbut perhaps Guyse has told you all this

No indeed we dont have very much to say to one another

Well the legend is that the attacking enemy made a breach in the
masonry of the Gatehouse tower and that a bull jumped out through the
hole and fell into the ravine That is why they call the causeway the
Bulldrop

I didnt know it was so called

Yes it is and the legend goes on to assert that when another bull
shall drop into the ravine there shall occur the birth of a fairhaired
Guyse and the Guyses of Guysewyke shall come into their own again

Does that mean get back their lands

The folk hereabout think it means that title and all shall pass to the
elder branch The present Lord Caryngston you know belongs to the
junior line the title having been conferred on his greatgrandfather

The present Mr Guyse has quite black hair

You havent seen his brother

His brother I didnt know he had one

Oh yes they are twins and Wilfrid is as fair as he is dark Well I
must not keep you here chattering but go and see my patient Lead on
please

They proceeded up the newel Olwens brain busy with the facts just
learned

Dr Balmayne while not recommending any more sleigh drives at present
urged his patient to as much change of air as the Pele could afford He
said the banqueting hall was the only really airy room in the house and
that she ought to spend the greater part of her time in it Olwen
eagerly said that she was quite sure that could be arranged but as she
marked the obstinate fold of the ladys pale lips she guessed that in
face of the patients opposition no orders of the doctor could be
carried out

As they passed from the bedroom to the sittingroom the doctor asked
What has become of the ayah

Oh I dont expect she is far off but she asked me to bring you
upstairs she is very anxious not to seem to be usurping any prerogative
of mine

Dear me he said in a tone of great surprise She must have altered
very much of late

Why was she jealous of the last companion But I forgot I ought not
to ask you that question

They had reached the hall once more Oh he said there can be no
harm in my saying that the Hindu was very jealous of Miss Martin and
they never got on well

Why she is kindness itself to mealmost too kind She overwhelms me
with devotion She has some sort of superstitious idea that it is her
destiny to serve me Look here she held out her hands the nails
beautifully manicured then turning her back to display her head Are
you a judge of hairdressing What do you think of this for a winters
morning in the wilds of the Border Why do you look at me like that

In fact his expression was that of consternation II am
surprisedwhat you tell me surprises me What can be the womans
object For she does nothing without an object

To induce me to stay I should think laughed Olwen She may have
found that it is not easy to detain anybody young in this weird spot

That may be he said slowly but not as if he were convinced Are
you an orphan he asked abruptly and her reply that she was caused him
to furrow his brow He said nothing however picking up his hat and
gloves slowly from the table

Looking up he caught her anxious eyes and a smile kindled in his own
Certainly the coiffure is tiptop but Sunia had fine material to work
upon if I may be pardoned the remark Tone and manner were alike just
right and she laughed with a clear mind

Shall you be coming again she wished to know

Oh yes Mrs Guyse must not leave her room until I have seen her It
is a great thing for her to have your society but II feelhe dropped
his voiceas if I ought perhaps to utter one word of warning The ayah
is not to be trusted and

She smiled up at him with limpid eyes Are you going to echo Mrs
Askwiths warning to keep Muster Nin at a distance she replied in
the same undertone Well you neednt be uneasy We are not hitting it
off I have had to administer one or two snubs and he now says he
thinks I was born to be the mistress of a reformatory

They went out together into the frosty twilight When they had gone
some steps she remarked The hall is not a safe place in which to talk
You never know where the ayah is However she is welcome to have
overheard all that we have said today

Mrs Askwiths advice was good I am in a position to tell you that it
was by no means unnecessary But I think you are all right you seem to
have plenty of sense Would it be an impertinence if I asked how you
happened to come here

Oh very simply I advertised and Mrs Guyse answered my
advertisement It wasnt quite what I wanted but they pay well and I
thought it would be a beginning I dont expect to be here very long
and if it grows in any way uncomfortable I shall leave

Good he said and added after thought I wish you were not quite so
isolated You have literally no neighbours There is nobody nearer
than the vicarage at Lachanrigg and Mr and Mrs Baines are both over
seventy so during the winter they might as well not exist as far as the
Pele is concerned

They strolled out across the Bulldrop Just as they reached the outer
gate Ninian Guyse rode up mounted on Deloraine

Hallo said he with a swift glance at the two Risked your precious
Fordette on these roads eh

Dont you sneer at my tinkettle Shes as game a little machine as
ever hummed along these Godforsaken tracks replied Balmayne Well
Ive seen your mother and she ought soon to be all right Just a
slightly relaxed throat which has sent up her temperature I am telling
Miss Innes to persuade her to pass more time in your billiardroom or
library whatever you call it It is spacious and airy and while she
goes out so little she must take all the air she can get indoors

Yes the doctor has put an idea into my head chimed in Olwen as the
doctor shook hands and hastened to where his chauffeur was cranking up
the motor Goodbye doctor and thank you Ill expect the medicine
by the postman tomorrow and yourself the day afterand Ill remember
all your directions

The car started Ninian after standing a moment as if in profound
thought took Deloraines bridle and Olwen and he walked across the
causeway

Dr Balmayne has been telling me that they call this the Bulldrop
said she conversationally

Oh indeed What more has he been telling you I wonder

Something extremely interestingthat there is a well under the floor of
the hall I do so want to see it

Theres nothing to see

Oh if its any trouble it really doesnt matter in the least Please
forget that I mentioned it and let me say a word about Madam I have
been wondering why she doesnt use the billiardroom more it is much
the nicest room in the house and not a bit draughty and I believe I
have discovered the reason

He turned his face to her but the gathering night hid his expression
You have noticed that my mother doesnt like the billiardroom

Evidently she doesnt like being there

And you think you know why

Yes I think it is because she is not comfortable there There is no
sofa upon which she can lie down

I wonder if by any chance you are right he mused speaking for the
first time since she had known him quite earnestly and naturally It
might be worth trying

Exactly what I was going to suggest she broke in eagerly Of
course I can see that no sofa could be carried upstairs But I have
been studying the catalogue from Bartons the big Leeds people and
they have those canvas lounges which fold up With the cushions off the
diningroom sofa and some pillows we could make one of those quite comfy
for her The one I liked is only thirty shillings carriage paid We
could move back the settle put up the big leather screen set a table
close by and she would be almost as cosy as she is upstairs

He checked Deloraine in the courtyard and began to unsaddle him Its
a rattling good idea Ill write and order the thing tonight

Oh thanks I am glad you dont snub my poor little plan

Why should I snub it

Somehow I thought you would

You think you know all about me dont you

On the contrary how can I know anything except what you have shown
me

He made no answer and in the dusk she escaped hurrying upstairs to
tell Sunia what the doctor had said and to prepare a fomentation for
Madams throat




 CHAPTER XII

 A CONFIDENCE AND SOME SPYING


Madam lay nearly flat on her back under the canopy of her great fourpost
bed Her sunken eyes followed Miss Innes curiously as she measured a
dose of medicine into a glass

Approaching the bed the girl stopped slipped an arm under the thin
shoulderblades and lifting her patient administered the draught

Thats to lower your temperature said she encouragingly You will
feel much better when you are less feverish

As she rearranged the bed and rinsed the glass she gave news of the
beloved fowls Kitty one of the buff Orpingtons regardless of the
time of year had insisted upon going broody and Mrs Baxter having
tried various cures in vain had at last given her a clutch of eggs
Madam speculated sadly upon the problem of keeping the chickens alive
when hatched

Olwen hopefully suggested that the weather might be very different in
six weeks time

It wont Not for months and months You dont know this place This
accursed place added Madam faintly under her breath

Oh dont call it that I find it extraordinarily fascinating
Nothing else like it anywhere is there

Lets hope not Ah its all very fine for you to laugh If you had
been through all I have undergone She broke off muttering to
herself Olwen could see that she was under the influence of fever and
spoke soothingly

Im sorry I hardly know why I laughed Laughter comes easily to me
I think

Youre lucky I never had a merry nature and if I could have seen
into my future

She moved restlessly while Olwen sat down near with her knitting

Silence fell How intense silence could be in that place The thick
walls shut off each room in a solitude of its own No sounds of daily
life arose to the listening ear one might be isolated from everyone
else in the world As Olwen meditated on this the hush was broken by
the voice of Madam who began to speak in a low monotonous narrative

I was born in a palacea mansion on Streatham Hill standing in a great
park My father rose from small beginnings to be one of the richest men
in England He was very ambitious for me his only child In the
course of business he had come across Lord Caryngston and had been able
to oblige his lordship pretty substantially It was arranged in return
that her ladyship should present me at Court and invite me to her house
to meet her friends That was how I came to know Ninian Guyse My
father did not like the match but he wanted me to be happy and I was
spoiled and wilful I was head over ears in love What a fool Ah
what a fool Ninian Guyse was as deep in debt as I in love and only
wanted my fortune

Oh dont say that cried the girl

The wistful eyes were turned upon her face Its true she said
defiantly Why should I not say it Oh I suppose you mean I ought not
to say it to you But that will be all right as long as you dont tell
Ninian The drawn face assumed a look of deep cunning Not a word to
my son or to ayah Understand Why not our little secrets you and
me  Where was I Oh yes we were married you know and as long as
my father lived he exercised some kind of control but to my deep
misfortune he died and then there was nothing to hold my husband He
went from bad to worse I would not live with him at last The twins
and I usually lived in London and he at Danley our Yorkshire place He
was an excellent jockey and he sometimes rode his own horses That was
how he caught his death  riding a race he felt certain of winning
He meant if he pulled that off to turn over a new leaf or so he said
He just failed and standing about afterwards he took a chill

And died

Yes It turned to pneumonia and he made no sort of fight
Disappointment had beaten him down I think he was sorry just at the
end but it was too late then he had taken everything from memy love
my fortuneand flung it all away Until he was dead I had no idea how
completely he had ruined us It was the twins last term at Rugby they
were going to Oxford that autumn When he found out how things were
Ninian said we must sell all our other houses and the yacht and the
racing stables and come and live here I wanted to sell this horrible
place too but Ninian would not hear of it So terribly masterfuljust
like his father He always was a farmer at heart he loves the land
Wilfrid is so different

At the mention of the name of this beloved son the whole tone of Madams
voice changed Colour stole into her cheeks a thrill into her voice
Do you see that photo on the dressingtable in the silver frame
Bring it to me

Olwen brought the picture to the bedside Unless it was flattered
Wilfrid Guyse was indeed a handsome man There was a likenesseven a
strong likenessto his twin especially in general outline but his hair
was evidently fair and his expression wholly different There was no
bravado no sign of a sneer in these clear wellopened eyes The
carriage of the head was fine with the unconscious confidence of race

Do you like it The acme of maternal pride surged beneath the quiet
question

Olwen started The portrait had fascinated her Like it Oh yes
There is a great likeness to his brother is there not

Mrs Guyse laughed in pure scorn Wait until you see them together
said she Nobody would look at poor Nin while Wolf was present
Though I say it he is all the fondest mother could desire

Does he come home much asked Olwen with a good deal of curiosity as
to the answer

Not so much as I could wish He is secretary to Mr Borrowleigh who
is in the Cabinet you know London is far from Guysewyke and they
work him terribly hard poor boy He tried nobly to retrieve the family
fortunes when he left Oxfordwent to Klondyke starved and toiledyou
would never think it to look at him would you My poor darling It
was too much for him He broke down and had to come home and begin all
over again However his health is now quite restored

This photo was taken recently

He had it done for my Christmas present

Olwen slowly replaced the frame upon the table When she turned round
Mrs Guyse had raised herself erect and her face was darkly flushed
There was a disturbed look in her eyes Ive been talkingtalking
she muttered Ninian said I should be sure to talk

Well why not asked Olwen gently I am your secretary and your
affairs are private to me I am in the same position as a doctor you
know What you say to me is a professional secret But I think you
have talked enough and should lie down now

The sick woman grasped her arm with hot fingers Have I said anything
to set you against Ninian oror the place she asked uneasily

Olwen was obliged to laugh Of course not though it could not matter
even if you had

You said didnt youyou told me you found the Pele fascinating

It has a fascination certainly

So have you returned Madam most unexpectedly Her eyes were fixed
upon the girls mirthful face and the pretty curve of her smiling mouth
I consider you decidedly fascinating I cant think where Ninians
eyes are

Tastes differ you know was the amused reply As you approve that
is all that matters isnt it Perhaps Mr Guyse will forgive me for
being unattractive when he finds I am useful

Mrs Guyse lay silent for a while during which time she was presumably
thinking over her indiscretions At last

Wolf wont be coming here for a long time said she in a decided
voice so dont build upon seeing him will you

Its very disappointing but Ill try to bear it replied the girl
demurely dissembling her mirth

After another pauseI fear I was unwise to show you his picture Are
you susceptible do you think

I believe not You see when one has to earn ones living one has no
time to be fanciful

I dare saywith evident relief It was very different with me I
had been so spoilt my father doted on me I had everything I wanted I
had but to express a wish and it was gratified That was what made the
contrast after marriage so dreadful to me I had been so flattered
that I thought myself very attractive and I was not My husband told
me so in plain words He said I expected too much You are not
accustomed to flattery are you You would not expect too much

Olwen began to be alarmed at her high colour and rambling talk I want
you to lie down and rest and not talk said she coaxingly I think I
will go and ask Sunia to bring your tea

Wait A thin hand was held up and beckoned Olwen approached the bed
Bend down I want to whisper

Olwen stooped a queer access of pity in her heart

I have been imprudent If you repeat what I have said you will get me
into trouble but all the same I am going to warn you Ayah is his
spyNinians spy Be careful wont you

The colour flamed into the girls face This was her second warning
that day not to trust Sunia Ill remember and please to understand
that I dont talk said she as impressively as she could

She felt uncomfortable as she took up the Barton catalogue and carried
it downstairs to point out to Mr Guyse the lounge chair which she
thought would be suitable

He was standing upon the hearthrug as she entered the lamplit room
and to her surprise he met her with a scowl

What does this portend she asked herself as she went to the tray and
sat down to pour out his tea The kettle sang on the hob there was a
fragrance of hot teacake and the table looked tempting with its
crystal glasses of preserve and old Jacobean silver Ignoring his
silence she began to talk I have brought the catalogue to show you
How long will it be before we can get what we order do you know I am
wondering how you manage to collect things sent by rail

He was sitting at the side of the table at right angles to her and as
he leaned forward his sulky face was close to hers

I wonder he said if on the occasion when I came to fetch you from
Caryngston I succeeded in impressing upon you the fact that I am
anxious for you to have no dealings with Balmayne

Resenting his tone in every fibre of her Olwen opened her mouth to say
What concern is it of yours but remembering in time her position in
the household she replied merely You impressed upon me the idea that
you and he are not on good terms

So you thought you would have a nice confidential talk with him about
meeh

Oh What makes you think so she asked calmly

He was ready for this question Mrs Baxter told me what time the
doctor arrived I know what time he went Sunia told me how long he was
in the sickroom

Was that all that Sunia told you she asked innocently

He reddened Olwen summoned all her courage and leaning back in her
chair she looked steadily into his eyes which gleamed in a way which
made her think absurdly of a panther lashing his tail

We had better have this out she said quietly If as I suppose
Sunia was listening and if she has repeated to you all that passed
between the doctor and me you must know that nothing was said of which
you could reasonably complain Please understand that I did not come
here to take my orders from you and that I will not be bullied by you
If your mother has anything to complain of in my conduct she will tell
me so I know my place I wish that you knew yours

He sat upright as if she had stung him and gazed upon her as if he
hardly knew how to take this

If you were not here she went on Madam and I could get on very
comfortably together but ever since you saw me you have been trying to
make things intolerable for me After the way you have just spoken I
shall of course leave at my month But as long as I am here perhaps
you will let me alone

He made a contemptuous sound Thats just like a womanflare up at a
little thing like that You give notice to leave just because I got a
bit shirty over you and Balmayne

Why you made up your mind from the first that I shouldnt stay didnt
you When you found that I am not pretty and that I wont flirt with
you

By Jove how can you say that Why I tried with all my might to be
friends but you wouldnt touch me with the end of a barge pole

You knew quite well that you were behaving in a way no girl could
stand

He folded his arms gazing down at the tablecloth I dont know any
girls At least none like you

Something in his tone made her feel a little sorry for him but she
hastened to improve the occasion a little farther

Why cant you understand that I only want to be let alone What do you
matter to me From the way you talk I suppose that Dr Balmayne knows
something to your discredit and that you are afraid he might tell me
Well what if he did It is of no business of mine It doesnt
interest me As for Madamwhen I first came I thought she disliked me
as much as you do but the last day or two she has seemed
gladpleasedto have me with her She has begun toto welcome me to
turn toward me as if shellloved me And now I must leave her all
because youyou

She could not finish She was swallowing sobs and to her own vast
mortification was obliged to rise from the table and turn away to the
fire so as to hide her quivering face

She heard him push back his chair and rise too He took a turn to the
end of the room and back Then he came near to where she stood

Im a perfect brute he said gruffly I saycant we start all over
again Do let us I cant think why things have gone so badly You
got up against me somehow I thought you were so different I cant
explain If I say that Im fairly ashamed of myself and beg your pardon
with all my heart wont you give me another chance

I dont know what you mean said she furtively wiping away her tears
Another chance I never gave you a chance at all You dont count
Why should you

Thats just what I mean I want to count Give me a chance

She made no reply

I never had a sister or perhaps I shouldnt be such a blundering fool
with girls adventured Nin Look here cant you be great enough to
hand me out a free pardon I never guessed how much I was going to hurt
your feelings just now and if Madam is to lose you just because of my
thundering folly Ah well you guessed quite right Balmayne does
think he knows something to my discredit and I was anxious you should
not hear it from him I wanted to keep it dark altogether But I
suppose Id better tell you about it myself

But I dont want to know Will nothing make you see that it doesnt
matter a bit to me

Youd have listened to Balmayne

He declined to say anything when he found I didnt know

Ah then he did mention it

If we are talking of the same thing

Lily Martin of course the girl who was my mothers companion

Oh yes I remember He said that your mother had rather a shattering
experience

I suppose she had Yes it was a shock he replied slowly Look
here dry your eyes and sit down to tea and Ill tell you afterwards
if youll promise not to go away at the end of your month This place
is quite jolly in fine weather

She sat down to table and poured fresh tea I have no doubt it is
said she You will enjoy showing it to my successor You should
explain to her however when offering her the post that she is to be
your companion and not Madams

Now youre not playing fair No good to say you forgive me and then
stab me in the back

I dont think I have forgiven you At least I havent said so

He looked at her with puzzled eyes You try living here ten years
with never a soul to speak to and see if you dont make an ass of
yourself the first time you get the chance he remarked presently

She did not answer but took up the catalogue and made a little talk
about the folding chairs depicted in the illustrations

He gave but a divided attention and ate hardly anything At last he
pushed back his chair with determination Now will you please listen

She rose with decision Once for all Mr Guyse I will not listen
I have already told you that I dont want to hear anything at all about
it As she spoke she was moving as if to go out of the room He rose
with pantherlike swiftness and stood between her and the door Youve
got to listen he said




 CHAPTER XIII

 NINIANS DEFENCE


Olwens heart gave a throb and for a moment she was afraid Then she
remembered how quickly Ninian had been disarmed by the sight of her
distress She lifted a beseeching face to him

Please Mr Guyse Please believe what I say I would rather know
nothing of your private affairs I am not likely to remain long at the
Pele and it is best that we remain strangers

We cant do that he said with sharp decision Ask Sunia

Your spy she said throwing into the words an amount of scorn which
brought the colour to his face He did not falter however Taking her
arm just above the elbow he led her to the hearth and pushed her
gently into a chair This is the last time I am going to misbehave
said he After this you shall do as you like with me but you have got
to hear me now Sorry but really youve got to

But why Why she cried

Because I insist

She wavered He was standing over her and it seemed to her quite
probable that if she made as if to rise he would push her back into
her chair She could see that he was putting all the force of his will
into the affair and after all was it worth fighting him about She
hardly cared for herself whether she heard him or no and was chiefly
conscious of a wish that he would leave off importuning her With a
shrug of the shoulders she resigned herself and Ninian with a sigh of
relief seated himself upon a big pouffe which stood on the rug facing
her Daffs head between his knees

Thus settled he looked up with an impertinent grin

The Head of the Reformatory has given leave to the latest arrival to
explain to her how he first came to leave the paths of virtuous
rectitude he said She faces him calmly judicial and he proceeds
to make a clean breast of it

She had some ado not to laugh Get on and dont be silly said she

He drew a deep breath One black dark night a band of robbers he
began No Thats the wrong gambit Ahem I was not ever thus
believe fair maid

Olwen made to rise from her place and he caught and detained her

Oh dash how is it that I cant resist playing the goat cried he
Just one more chance and that will be the very last but the mischief
of it is I dont know where to begin Afraid I shall have to go back to
our first coming to live here I was about eighteen then and it really
was the only thing to do my father had left us in such a tight place
Madam had been accustomed to something very different it was horribly
rough on her and I dare say youll think I was a selfish hound to bring
her to such a place But I couldnt help myself Im Guyse through
and through and though I felt that I would give up most things for her
I simply couldnt sell the last Guyse stronghold and the last few poor
acres So there it is The first crimes off my chest

I can make every allowance for you there said Olwen with a rush of
sudden sympathy

He looked at her under his lashes Thats something You see by
coming to live here I managed to send my brother Wilfrid to Oxford
Hes a credit to the familybrains and manners and so on The other
reason was that I knew I could make a living out of the land and also
that if I lived here Madam need not lose all her friends and I could
get across a horse and carry a gun If we had lived in a city I couldnt
have earned bread and cheese Ive no commercial ability and Madam
would have suffered more though she doesnt think so Hallo Im sorry
Im boring you with what doesnt matter a bit When we had been here a
few years and Wolf had left the University he was suddenly bitten with
the notion of going to Klondyke This upset my mother very much made
her so ill in fact that we thought she would go melancholy mad Wolf
and I talked it over and he said she was moped to death and too much
alone and the best thing we could do was to hire a young lady to live
with her somebody young and jolly who would take her out of herself
We did as we did in your case looked down a list of advertisers and at
last we chose Miss Lily Martin She came and she was a girl with high
spirits very goodnatured and used to make Madam laugh She was here
some time more than a year and we jogged along well enough only Sunia
never took to her

Do you know why that was

Sunia said she was not pukkaI expect you know what that means Said
also that she had something up her sleeve Said she had a lover He
was speaking with his gaze fixed on Daffs silky head but on that he
raised his face and his eyes were hard as jade in the lamplight Of
course Balmayne thinks I was her lover said he

Why does he think so

Ill tell you After about a year things began to go wrong I expect
Miss Martin got a bit fed up with this place and the monotony of the
life I couldnt even send Madam away for a few weeks in the summer
that year for Wolf had got into difficulties and it took all I had to
send him what he asked for Miss Martins temper changed Sunia told
us afterwards that when she first came she got letters constantly
always two or three a week sometimes more By degrees they had dropped
off until of late she had only one or two a month I suppose this
upset her anyway she became moody and had fits of temper I didnt
mind her working it off on me but when it came to Madam I had to
interfere for she took to bullying her One day she had a queer
outburst I had found Madam in hysterics and I was obliged to call the
girl over the coals about it She flew out at me and said we were
bloated aristocrats but that she was as good as us any day and that
if she only chose she could make things hot for us To this day I
dont know what she meant by that On my honour I dont believe her
change of manner had anything to do with me I may have chaffed her a
bit but I never made love to her However the end of it was that I
told her I thought she had better leave She was evidently no longer
happy with us and what was more she didnt make Madam happy either
I couldnt have her upsetwhy the only reason the silly fool was in the
house at all was to keep Madam happy  So I gave her notice After
that we had a treat The first week she was furious the second sulky
the third tearfuloh my word She wept at meals she wept in her
bedroomso Sunia saidshe wept all over poor Madam and one day sheshe
wept on me I couldnt stick it and I am afraid I told her so more
hotly than I meant Ah I can see your sympathy for her showing in your
eyes

You are quite mistaken I was thinking that when you succeeded in
making me cry this evening you must have been forcibly reminded of poor
Miss Martin

He grinned After that it seemed to me that it would be better if I
kept out of the way until she took her departure I was very busy at
the time as it happened so I stayed down at Lachanrigg with the Kays
and had all my meals there next day When I came home late at night
Sunia and the Baxters were in a fearful state Miss Martin had
disappeared

You mean she had left

Nobody knew It seems she had spent the afternoon in the billiardroom
by herself Madam at that time used always to sit there but she had
got so fed up with the girl that on that occasion she went off to her
own room and shut herself in Sunia afterwards told us that Miss
Martin after an interval of five weeks had got a letter that morning
which had visibly upset her She seems to have made a fire in the
billiardroom and burned therein her whole collection of letters Sunia
took her a cup of tea and found her kneeling on the hearth feeding the
fire with torn letters and noticed that she was in tears Nobody saw
her after that She had not put on a hat so they thought for a long
time that she was concealed somewhere in the house where there are a
good many hidingplaces We began by searching pretty thoroughly and
when we proved unsuccessful I thought I would go down to Lachanrigg by
the short cut down the hill and get Kay to come and help me or advise
me what to do

Did you know where she came fromwho were her people

She was living in rooms in London when we engaged her She had no
home She came originally from Canada I believe We knew of no
friends to whom she would be likely to go

Where did her letters come from

Always London We thought probably from a clerk in some bank for the
address was typewritten Well as I was telling you I went out and
down the hill It is almost precipitous down there but there is a path
of sorts winding among the trees Just as I went crashing down the
steepest bit I thought I heard a moan It was a very dark night and I
could see nothing I had a lantern with me and I turned it this way and
that The sound came several times and it seemed to be behind me
higher up the hill After questing all about I found it was always
above me over my head and at last I had the wit to peer up into the
branches of the trees There I found her She had flung herself out of
the big oriel in the banqueting hall intending to commit suicide and
had stuck in the branches of an ash

Alive of course

Oh yes but she was badly injured I had to go and rouse Ezra and
between us we got her down and carried her to the Gatehouse where we
laid her in Mrs Baxters parlour It was not possible with her broken
bones to get her upstairs at the Pele so in the Baxters parlour she
stayed Balmayne had only just come here then and he was immensely
interested in the case Thought she was a poor martyred saint victim
of my heartless cruelty As for me I was just about fed up with her
and I kept clear of her all the time she was ill She utterly declined
to say why she had tried to kill herself and only declared that she
wished she had succeeded in her attempt At first she said that the
moment she was strong enough to get about she would have another try
but Balmayne explained to her that unless she took a solemn oath not to
repeat it he would have to inform a magistrate and get her bound over
That frightened her a bit but she remained in a queer state of mind
very unsatisfactory it was for all concerned

What did Madam say

Madam behaved very queerly I suppose Balmayne got at her for she
certainly believed that I was seriously to blame She said she pitied
the poor girl from the bottom of her heart but for all that she could
not be persuaded to go and see her I thought it would be a jolly good
thing if she did as she might get something out of her but no Never
once did she see Miss Martin from the day of the accident to the day of
her departure

Departure She went away then

Yes I was at my wits end wondering what on earth was to become of
the poor thing and making up my mind that I must screw myself to the
point of making Madam go and see her and ask what her plans were when
she got a letter from the usual source This letter seemed to buck her
up no end She told Mrs Baxter next day that she was going to London
as soon as the doctor would allow her to travel And she was as good as
her word When she went off she informed me that I should see her again
a great deal sooner than I expected and I was fully prepared for a
letter from some firm of lawyers threatening an action of some kind
But from that day to this we havent any of us heard a word of her The
earth might have opened and swallowed her She was a queer one Sunia
says she had a weddingring slung round her neck under her clothes but
I dont know if that is true There Now you have heard the history of
Miss Lily Martin and myself to date When Balmayne gives you his
version you can put the two together and see what they amount to

Olwen rested her elbows on her knees her chin cupped in her hands and
gazed thoughtfully at the glowing logs And all that happenedwhen

More than three years ago

I wonder what made you tell me

Its pretty obvious If you stay on you are bound to hear it and I
wanted you to hear it from me

II think I am glad you told me She was in fact conscious of
considerable relief The story explained many things Debs distrust
of the young man Balmaynes uneasiness that another girl should be
placed in the same position as the unlucky Lily Mrs Guyses reticence
and anxiety Sunias careful spying and most of all Ninians
selfconsciousness and inability to be natural with her

Well after hearing this pretty tale shall you funk staying in the
Dark Tower he asked after a prolonged survey of her grave little
face lit by the flickering flamelight

I think I am safe enough she replied not turning her head to look at
him I am not a bit a LilyMartin kind of girl

Give a chap a chance Cant I see that much But you know there is
another kind of girl just as bad and when first I saw you I thought you
were that kind

Indeed What

A prude

Well the firelight emphasised the dimple I think I am rather that
kind That is I am apt to be thorny except with

People who speak your language The tone was soft and insinuating

Thats it

Well said Nin laying his olive cheek down on Daffs yellow head
Im going to learn if it takes me a year As I just told you Ive
misbehaved for the last time I am now a reformed character your word
is my law If you say Detestable young man leave the room hard as
that command will be I shall obey Ill be like a lover out of
Richardson or Mrs Radcliffe

Oh but please I dont want you to be like a lover of any kind

My mistake Im a pupil am I not And youre my teacher if youll
take me on Oh do I know it the only thing to save my yet young
life in the wilds of time

With the poets at your fingerends there is no excuse for you she
laughed Dont be so ridiculous

Oh come youll have to let me be ridiculous Prunesprism was never
my line

It need not be your line or mine either when once you have mastered
the simple little rules and few which lie at the root of the language
you have to learn

Cant we begin now

Not now Really I dont want to be crabby any more but you do see
that while Madam is so poorly I must look after her dont you She
broke off and a wicked smile flashed at him Why all the silly fool
is in the house for at all is to keep Madam happy

Jove youre quick I must mind my ps and qs with you

Yes they are rather important letters in your new alphabet




 CHAPTER XIV

 A FRESH START


When Olwen came into her room that evening to prepare for supper Sunia
was curled up as usual upon the rag before the fire mending some tiny
rent in one of the young ladys garments The room was now always warm
and fragrant a welltrimmed lamp on a bracket made a soft effulgence of
light candles were lit on the toilet table and the carving on the
ancient furniture shone with polish

Olwen tried to shut her eyes to all this creature comfort As she
walked in she left the door open behind her and halting in the middle
of the room she pointed to the way out You may go Sunia said she
coldly

Sunia looked up Evidently she was unprepared for this but almost
immediately she had herself completely in hand She rose to her knees

My Missee not want me this night

No nor any other night Go please

The womans eyes dwelt as if in admiration on the determined little
face What poor ole ayah done she asked

You dont need to be told that You are a spy and I wont have spies
about me

Who say Sunia spy

Your own sahib He told me all about it You come pretending to love
me and then go and make mischief I have done with you Please go

The Hindu prostrated herself laying her forehead upon the buckle of
Olwens shoe

Missee forgive herforgive ole ayah this one time She not do it again
Only because she frightened of pretty doctor he look at Missee with too
kind eyes and Sunia seen pictures in the starspictures that say the
doctor he come between Missee and my sahib Ole ayah obliged to warn
her sahiband good thing too very good thing she done it

Why is it a good thing What are you talking about

It was very rarely that the ayah smiled but the ghost of a smile
crossed her lips as she replied My sahib angry and Missee and him
they have it out together and now they friends Good thing that eh

Then you were listening behind the curtain in the diningroom while we
talked

I was not I tell you no How can I be leesten when I busy unpack
all my Missees things and put em away

Olwen gave an exclamation of surprise She was not aware that her heavy
luggage had arrived but now she noticed that all her small possessions
had been unpacked and arranged with some taste about the room

Why how did you unlock my trunk Where is it It could not come
upstairs

The ayah laughed low All trunks got to stay in kitchenhouse
outside said she Ole ayah find Missee key right enough and carry
things up in her arms Missee tell her how she want em eh

She rose from the ground quivering with delight at having turned the
subject and her eyes were alight with eagerness

Olwen shrugged her shoulders I am much obliged for all the trouble
you have taken and for putting away my things so carefully but for all
that I cannot forget that you are not to be trusted You make believe
to love me and then act treacherously

No that wrong said the woman earnestly Ole ayah serve Missee and
serve sahib too Missee dont really think ole ayah tell about her to
anybody else Only to the sahib because all Missee do is right for him
to know

How absurd cried Olwen but she could catch a glimpse she thought
of the Hindus logic The house of Guyse was what she served She
devoted herself to Olwen only because the girl was for a time part of
the Guyse household She suspected Balmayne of being anxious to
undermine Miss Inness opinion of her beloved sahib To protect him
she went eavesdropping

The girl gave a long sigh as she sank into her usual chair and felt in
a moment the ayahs eager hands busy with the fastenings of her dress

Missee trust ole ayah She can trust her always except Missee unkind
to my sahib

Olwen passed a hand across her eyes as if to clear away mist The face
of Madam as she eagerly urged her not to place confidence in Sunia was
present to her fancy She knew that the past hour had materially altered
her opinion of Ninian He had succeeded in diminishing if not in
dispersing her dislike She was sorry for him Yet something deep
within her kept on uttering a warning

She was like one upon whom a spell is being cast It was as though
Sunia had prepared a deep bath and had urged her to plunge therein
assuring her that it was what she needed that it would do her good and
make her happy As yet she had barely dipped her foot into the flood
the water was laving but her feet and ankles but even so she knew that
it was having some mysterious effect She foresaw that she would not
emerge as she went in Something within her was changing  and the
feel of the waters was delicious

Sunias brush was slipping through her torrent of hair hypnotising as
it passed It seemed to thrill as it touched the sentient scalp
engendering a feeling of perfect wellbeing as though all life were just
sensation

She discerned danger yet she yielded When the ayah had completed her
coiffure she brought a handglass that her Missee might study the
effect

The subdued tints of her complexion were fitly framed in the dusky gold
of the hair The eyes were clear pale in their dark setting Was she
really growing prettier or was it part of Sunias magic that she
should think so

Rebelliously she struggled against the feeling that she was beautiful
She had always held herself to be one of those lucky beings who can go
through life quite unobserved without noticeable beauty or noticeable
defect The reflection in the little mirror hardly bore out such an
idea The charm it revealed was perhaps subtle but it was nevertheless
apparent

The thought of having supper alone with Ninian made her selfconscious
until she took herself to task for a weakminded fool

She went in to see Madam on her way down She found her far more
comfortable and able to enjoy a cup full of Mrs Baxters daintily made
gruel Olwen settled her comfortably for the night before going down

Ninian was awaiting her but he greeted her with such a change of manner
as reassured her at once No more halfsneering compliments no more of
what she now supposed to have been ballons dessai designed to make
her show her hand His manner was open and almost pleasant Was Sunia
right after all Was it a good thing that they should have arrived at
an understanding

They talked about the procuring of the folding lounge for Madam and
Ninian explained that there was a station much nearer than Picton Bars
but that it was practically useless to the dwellers in the Pele because
the only road which approached their eyrie came from a totally different
direction They had to drive so far round to Raefell station upon such
bad roads that it was easier as a rule for them to go via Caryngston

Lachanrigg his farm whose tenant John Kay had married the Baxters
only daughter was on the way or not much off the road to this other
station It was quite easy to fetch goods from Raefell to Lachanrigg
but from Lachanrigg to the Pele the only possible route was on foot

Ninian was quite ready to carry the packedup lounge from Lachanrigg up
through the Guyseburn woods and suggested that he should walk down to
Lachanrigg next day drive thence to Raefell and telephone from the
station to Leeds ordering the couch to be sent at once

She was eager in her thanks and inquired whether he would have to go
down the steep hill immediately underneath the windows

He said yes that was the only way and added I suppose you would not
care to come too Its quite a pleasant walk to Lachanrigg and back
and would not keep you out too long

Ill go she said if you are kind enough to take me and if Madam
will spare me The doctor isnt coming tomorrow

You wont find it so dull walking with me now that I am beginning to
talk the language said Nin insinuatingly

She laughed You have made strides in education today

Nothing like a Reformatory after all Training seems harsh at first
but good results are soon perceptible

Sorry I was harsh I never had a pupil before who required that kind
of training

Indeed One would have thought you had done it all your life Your
method was masterly

What was my method

Knocked him down stamped on him rolled him out quite flat picked him
up dusted him put him in the corner

And here he is sitting up and taking nourishment quite comfortably
In fact the process has exhausted the teacher far more than the pupil
She hopes another application will never never be necessary

It wont Ive sworn off taken the pledge and intend to wear the
white flower of the Innes Brigade all my life

There were a few Christmas roses in a vase upon the table and in a
moment of impulse Olwen took out one and handed it to him

I found these in the garden today and thought we might as well have
the sight of them said she The white flower of the Innes Brigade
conferred by the founder herself

Nin fastened the big white star in his coat

Sunia waiting silently upon them seemed to notice nothing

Didnt you say you would like to look down the well asked Nin as
they strolled out into the hall together

Yes I did but please if it is a bother dont think of troubling

Bother Of course not If you like this sort of stuff there are
heaps of things I can show you He was rolling back one of the rugs as
he spoke This is used every morning we get our drinking water from
it The water I brought up the hill is all right for household
purposes but this is better

He disclosed a circular hole fitted with a flat cover They both knelt
down while he lifted the lid and he held a lighted taper over the
black abyss thus revealed

At one of the other Peles they have a tame electric light at the end of
a rope said he and they let it down till it hangs just above the
water You get a fine effect then I wish we could do it

For the first time in his company Olwen forgot herself and spoke as to a
friend Oh wouldnt it be grand Fancy having electric light here
all up the corkscrew and in those fascinating little passages

He sat back upon his heels looking at her oddly You like this old
place then

Like is hardly the right word It grips me It is so unlike anything
I ever saw

You never could see anything just like it unique

Are you not glad that it is yours she went on carried away by the
thought Guyses built it Guyses dwelt in it and still it stands and
still a Guyse holds it Dont you wish another bull would jump down the
Bulldrop and the luck come back to you

He shrugged his shoulders I hardly know I dont want the humbugging
title There was no Lord Caryngston a hundred and fifty years ago but
there have been Guyses at Guysewyke since Domesday My cousin the
present Baron would give his eyes to own this place He hopes that I
shall be driven to sell it one day

Oh dont cried Olwen so fervently that he laughed

You wouldnt sell in my place

In your place I would live on a shilling a week but I wouldnt sell

He gave a sigh which was almost a groan God knows I think as you do
he answered but its not so simple as that He replaced the cover
and rose with lips close set One day perhaps I may tell you about
it said he




 CHAPTER XV

 A COLD WALK


The sky was misty grey with a hint of blue just overhead No wind
stirred the snowladen trees and the frost was intense

Mrs Guyse always slept after lunch and seemed to think it an extremely
good idea that her companion should have a short walk while she rested

Be sure to be back in time to pour out my tea she stipulated Its
rough going down the hill but I suppose young people like to scramble
and Nin says he has been since the snow fell and knows it is passable

Olwen was quite ready to brave a little snow Ezra Baxter by his
masters order had put nails into her thick boots and she was anxious
to shake off the reproach of being a townbred miss who could not go out
in bad weather

Ninian at billiards the night before and at breakfast that morning had
maintained the improvement in his demeanour He seemed pleased to see
Miss Innes when she appeared and his attitude was now that of the
courteous host anxious that his visitor should feel at home and be
entertained Dr Balmayne was not expected that day Madams condition
was steadily improving In spite of her statement that she disliked
being read aloud to Olwen had made an attempt that morning with the
Professional Aunt and the result had been encouraging The dull
creature had been roused momentarily from her torpor smiled several
times laughed once and said she would like to hear more later on
This success coupled with her expressed desire that her companion
should pour out her tea elated that young person considerably

Do you think she asked as she joined Ninian in the hall that you
could carry Madam down the one flight from her room to the banqueting
hall

He seemed in no doubt of his ability to perform this feat even in the
narrow limits of the newel stair

If so well have her down the moment we get the couch replied Miss
Innes eagerly I am really quite keen upon shaking her out of her
apathy and getting her to take an interest in things

Bravo he said Who would have thought such a scrap of a girl as
you Holy Moses I beg your pardon

She made a little mock bow But what my friends may say and what
strangers may say are so different

Thanks Thats the best yet was his reply as he selected an
ironshod stick for her You ought to feel bucked he added as he
opened the hall door Sunia licking your boots Madam sitting up and
taking notice already and me wagging my tail like anything for a kind
word

Good weeks work do you think demurely

Not to mention the doctor he went on

Now dont spoil it

Got to be jolly careful still he laughed leading the way to the
quadrangle wall behind the kitchen where in the southwest corner was
a tiny postern door

He stood a minute whistling Daff before opening it She came bounding
golden and beautiful from the kitchen door which was opened by Sunia

The Hindu stood in the opening her face grave and soft gazing at the
two as Olwen waved her a farewell She raised her hand in a curious
gesture as of benediction The postern opened and they passed through
upon the narrow terrace which on this side edged the ravine below

Standing there Olwen raised her eyes to the oriel in the banqueting
hall The stone mullions were wide enough apart for a slim girl to push
through and as the window projected considerably her fall would not be
broken by the very narrow platform upon which they stood

Below were the tips of the snowencumbered trees

Mad sort of idea wasnt it said Ninian answering her unspoken
thought Might have known she wouldnt get anything like a clean drop
Just a minutes temper probably

I cant think how people can do such a thing I love life far too
well Think of cutting oneself off for ever from sunset and moonrise
from waterfalls and mountains and hot weather in sunshine from roses
and lilies firesides and interesting books andandoh all the things
that make the world so fascinating

The world seems grim enough to me sometimes remarked the young man
kicking the steps free from piledup snow which had slid from the
battlements

Oh there are moments when it seems grim to anybody but you do
understand the joy of living dont you I mean the pleasure of just
being able to feel The sight of almond blossom against blue sky or of
the evening mist in a river valley or shallow water slipping over brown
stones or the smell of garden mould after warm rain

Or the outline of a girls face pink against the grey stone of a tower
wall Oh you cant complain of that Its all part of the subject
 and I do know what you mean George Eliot has something about it
somewhere I believe I could find it when we get home Yes it is
what makes the difference between people who can be happy in the country
and people who cant Lily Martin was one who couldnt This place
fairly got on her nerves as it does on my poor mothers Im glad it
doesnt get on yours for to bring you here in this weather was trying
you pretty high up If you can see beauty now you could see it
always

As he spoke he preceded her down the steps and guided her along an
almost level bit of ground to the place where the path plunged down
among the trees It was indeed steep but in fact easier with the
snow upon it than when it was bare trodden earth after a summers
drought Ninian helped her but not officiously and as she was really
active and strong as well as light and small she got along well A
short way down he showed her the tree upon which Lily Martin had fallen
and she was able to appreciate the difficulty which Baxter and he had
experienced in rescuing her

The precipitous part of the descent was soon over and they went on more
easily plunging through the snow and still thridding woodlands until
by degrees they dropped down almost to the level of the frozen river

Those woods observed Guyse waving a hand towards the rising ground
beyond the farther bank are full of wild cherry In April they are a
sight to make one feel thatwhat you were talking about just now

Olwen could believe it They turned to their right and walked along
some thirty feet above the bed of the stream following a good wide path
which ran under pines Then came some flat meadows which they crossed
the thin blue spiral from the farm chimneys encouraging them onward

The snow was very deep but this mattered only inasmuch as it impeded
progress But once did she suffer misfortune and this was when she
left the path to look at a curious lichen upon a treetrunk There was
a concealed ditch and instantly she was in the drift up to her waist

There was much laughter as she was lifted out by Ninian and dusted down
He remarked that it would teach her to be careful a saying so sensible
and bigbrotherly and so unlike his former style that she felt a very
natural triumph

Many dogs flew out baying as they approached Lachanrigg Daffs joyous
greeting seemed to set their minds at rest at once and they were
frisking round Ninian Their noise brought Mrs Kay to the door her
baby in her arms all excitement to know who could be approaching the
homestead on such a day by the woodland path

Kay was out but the sleigh and horse were in the stable and Ninian
soon had them harnessed and asked Olwen whether she would rather come
with him to the post office or stay and play with the baby Anxious to
show the reality of the truce she chose the drive and they started
off over a couple of miles of very exposed fell down into another
valley at the foot of which the railway scored a sharp black track upon
the blinding white The telephone was working and they rang up the
Newcastle shop gave their order and received a promise that the
folding lounge should be put upon the train that very afternoon and
would arrive at Raefell station next morning about eleven

Ninian at once volunteered to come and fetch it so that in the event
of Dr Balmayne giving permission Madam might be brought downstairs in
the afternoon

By the time the two walkers reached home in the January twilight they
were talking together quite easily

By special invitation Ninian had tea in his mothers room so that they
might all be together Madam lay among her pillows watching them with
her manner of vague faintly curious detachment

One of the cakes upon the plate had been baked in a droll resemblance to
an old mans whithered face Olwen called the attention of Mr Guyse to
it upon which he stuck it on a hatpin and together they proceeded to
dress it up with a paper collar and coat made of the little folded
damask napkin which held the cakes Even Madam was beguiled into
amusement She said little but after a while remarked to the girl
You seem to find everything amusing

Funny you should say that its the exact opposite of what Mr Guyse
thinks He calls me a schoolmarm and thinks I disapprove of
everything

That was because you didnt like me he cut in

Pardon it was because you didnt like me

Have you changed your mind

Have you changed yours

I asked first

So you should be answered last

Ah but it doesnt matter what I think it is your opinion that is the
important thing

Utterly wrong Madam is the only person whose opinion counts She
will think I am too noisy and silly if you go on like this I shall now
turn you out and read to her a little

Why turn me out I may have a pipe here maynt I Ma

Oh I never heard of such a thing cried Miss Innes with indignation
Its easy to see youve never been ill Out you go You must amuse
yourself till suppertime it was a huge treat your being allowed to
have tea with Madam and if you dont behave nicely you wont get
another invitation

She held the door open and he walked out his eyes twinkling What did
I tell you he turned back to say to his mother Schoolmarm

The girl smiling shut him out and turned to the bed removing the
empty cup and plate and restoring the order of the room with quick
touches She called Sunia who apparently passed most of her time
either in the stone passage or in the room next to Madams for she
always appeared with the minimum of delay to carry out trays or do other
behests

Madam made no comment at all upon the little scene just enacted She
lay quite still following the girls movements with her eyes only She
had rather the air of one who watches a comedy with a real though
veiled anxiety as to what the dnouement is likely to be

After the reading when her secretary rose to go and prepare for supper
she remarked You read aloud well and I like that book I do not like
all books

This is very light but when one is ill one likes something light

What I do not like is a book where the people have a guilty secret

Olwen laughed Thats so untrue to life said she

Do you think so The tone of the question surprised the girl It was
coldly ironic Youve not had much experience of life have you

Well said Olwen more than most girls of my age perhaps I have
lost both parents I have earned my living for three years

Madams lips curved in a slight smile Have you had many affairs of
the heart Have you ever had a lover

Olwen was near the bed measuring medicine into a glass as she put the
question The colour that flew into the girls face answered her

You have The inflection was of surprise Well now do you know I
should have guessed differently Would it be an impertinence on my part
to ask whether you are engaged to be married

Oh no certainly not said Olwen confusedly I mean it is not an
impertinence and I am not engaged

Not But you care for thethe gentleman

Olwen looked amused Dont you think I have all the aspect of a
lovelorn damsel

The faded eyes watched her with close attention Your friends
disapproved

Oh dear no It is merely thatthat the attachment was on the
gentlemans side not on mine was the reply

I must beg your pardon for my inquisition But perhaps it does concern
me a little I would not have selected a companion who was likely to
leave me soon to get married

Quite so I would have told you had there been any arrangement of the
kind You would have had a right to know

Do I understand that you definitely refused your suitor

Perhaps said Olwen after hesitation you may consider that I have
said enough An affair of this kind one should not talk of in my
opinion

And I have done little so far to earn your confidence replied Madam
speaking likewise after some musing She drank her draught and lay down
Might I ask you before going upstairs to find my son and tell him I
should like to speak with him for a few minutes

Olwen left the room and descended to the diningroom where Ninian was
seated before the fire with pipe and newspaper As she entered he
pushed towards her two envelopes which lay upon the small table beside
him Two letters for you said he You seem to have letters every
day The postman feels there is something to climb the hill for now

Does he not come when there are none for the Pele

Yes thats the devil of it The poor chap has to because as you
know he collects our post as well as delivering it and he never knows
until he gets here whether we have anything or not

That seems hard Cant you arrange a signal

Well I have sometimes thought I would Perhaps our united
intelligence could devise something

She took her envelopes from the table glancing at them with
pleasureone from Aunt Maud one from Grace Holroyd

Oh I am forgetting I came with a message to you from Madam She
wants to speak to you

Now

Yes now

Why what aboutdo you know

Havent any idea unless she desires to complain of me But I assure
you I havent been illusing her

He laughed extending his long legs and rubbing Daffs hot back gently
with one heel Best way to find out is to go and see I suppose he
remarked as he rose leisurely and with reluctance stretched himself
and left the room




 CHAPTER XVI

 A LITTLE FRICTION


Olwen lingered after his departure in the glowing warmth of the
hearth She curled herself up beside Daffodil on the rug and gave
herself the treat of reading Graces letter


Two such contradictory accounts as you have given me in the last few
days I never read wrote her friend What a place this Pele must be
And what deplorable people for the likes of you to have to live with
The only point that gives me any hope at all is that you seem even in
your second letter to have made up your mind not to stay It is absurd
that you should be wasting your talent and your technical training upon
a post which any silly spinster could fill with ease Even I could
measure out an old ladys physic and feed her fowls I could even go
sleighing with the cheeky young man who sounds rather attractive to me
Trust you to roll him out quite flat I can see you adoing of it
Anyway you will have had your experience and into the bargain a
months country air which you really needed I am not afraid that the
place will conquer you in spite of all you prate to me about the
atmosphere of the past and the ayahs magic which seems to consist
merely of josssticks You are too wholly a child of your age and the
need of a world of men is as strong in you as it was in the young man
who once landed at a farmhouse for a brief nights lovemaking You
will come back all right where you belong but in the meantime I hope
you are not having too thin a time Oh my dearly beloved having had
your little adventure couldnt you settle down to make poor old Ben
happy You know you could do just anything you like with him
strongminded old thing that he is in most ways Without you he will
close like an oyster never to open againthe process is beginning now
I watch it day by day With you he would bloom like a dullcoloured bud
in water that may when open be a flaming cactus for all you know to
the contrary You did confess to me that he surprised you when it came
to lovemaking It is my impression that he could surprise you a great
deal more if he got the chance Am I a selfish little pig to talk like
that It is frankly one for Ben and two for myself I want want want
you for a sister you make the world so different somehow The taste
goes out of things when you are not here If I were a man I would make
you marry me You are a sort of portebonheur which I should insist
upon annexing Write again soon your letters are absorbing and I am
discretion itself I dont give away anything to Ben though he looks at
me like a hurt dog begging for water when he sees me sniggering over
them Goodbye and God bless you

PSI wonder if the Guyses know how lucky they are I dont expect
it They think you are just an ordinary young female glad of any job
that prevents her eating the bread of dependence instead of being as
you are a pocket miracle


Olwen let the paper fall with a long sigh She had the impression of
hearing a voice which came from a vast distance What was real and
vivid at the moment was the snowy fell the hoary Pele wild weather
solitude and the Hindu womans spells The High Street of Bramforth
with its electric trams was becoming misty and dreamlike

Graces metaphor struck herwas all this just a night of
adventuresomething to be flung aside as soon as the need of a world
of men should once more grip her

For a few minutes she sat on chin in hand staring into the depths of
the flames then with a suddenness for which she could hardly account
she sprang to her feet and flew upstairsin the pitch dark for she
forgot to take the indispensable candle She knew the way by now and
it was far too narrow for error to be possible Without a pause she
sped on upward until she reached the haven of her own room wherein
Sunia and Sunias care awaited her It was like coming into realities
out of a nasty glimpse of something ugly She was too content to notice
the significance of her frame of mind


When she went down to supper that evening Mr Guyses mood had
completely changed He was gloomy and silent He had the aspect of one
who has received bad news and is plunged in depression

He quite failed to second her attempts at conversation and once or
twice when addressed came with an effort out of some apparently
painful train of thought His eyes rested upon Olwen with a puzzled
speculation as if either she or her actions had hurt and surprised him

She became convinced that he was a moody manveering in his temper
altogether unreliable and uncertain

As soon as supper was over he rose went to the mantelpiece lit his
pipe and muttered something about wanting to speak to Baxter Moving
to the door he turned his fingers on the handle and said I shall
stay over there with Baxter and smoke a pipe Dont stay up later than
you care to

With that he walked out and she heard him bang the door

A good deal relieved by his absence she went up to Madam with a clear
conscience

She thought the invalids eyes brightened at the sight of her but she
declined offers of reading or having her bed made saying Nin will be
lonely downstairs you had better go to him

He has deserted me said Olwen gaily He has gone to the Gatehouse
to smoke a pipe with Baxter so you and I can have a cosy evening Very
considerate of him I call it

Blank surprise seemed the predominant expression on Madams face

Dont you mind

Mind Mind what Being able to devote the evening to you Dear lady
why did I come here but to be with you and do all I can

A fleeting smile crossed the faded lips I suppose you really did I
never mentioned Nin in my letter to you did I

No you didnt If you had perhaps I shouldnt have come was the
mischievous reply as Olwen went to the door and clapped her hands to
summon the ayah

Sunia came in looking anything but pleased She glanced at the girls
careful toilet and coiffure and said sullenly that one did not make
beds when dressed for the evening

Pukka memsahibs dont but you see I am quite different I belong to
the working classes Suniasee teased the girl

Ayah knows better muttered the woman with a glance of mingled
affection and resentment She condescended however to help her
mistress from bed to the big chair by the fire Why you unkind my
sahib Why send him away she whispered to Olwen as they turned the
mattress together

I didnt do anything of the sort replied the girl aloud I went down
quite prepared to be nice to him but he was as cross as two sticks and
hardly spoke all dinner time Hes a spoilt disagreeable thing Sunia
and it is you who have spoilt him

This speech appeared to give quite remarkable pleasure to Madam who
looked rather spitefully at the ayah Hear what she says

Yes I hear very sulkily

You shouldnt go telling tales about me Sunia You have made
mischief went on Olwen gleefully

I told no talesnot since yesterday evening Missis here my Madam
perhaps she tell tales this day was the vexed retort

I The colour flew hotly into Madams face Sunia You forget
yourself Remember your place How dare you speak so

Olwen stood a minute glancing from one woman to the other Her mind
went seeking back over what had passed that evening Madam had asked
her whether she had a lover and had seemed disturbed by her reply She
had told her to send up Ninian but not for a moment had she connected
this summons with herself Yet his manner since he saw his mother had
completely changed It seemed too preposterous to imagine that he could
be in the sulks because his mother had told him that another man wanted
to marry Miss Innes Yet Madam had all the aspect of a guilty person
and Sunia was watching her with angry eyes

Its all nonsense I am only teasing Sunia dear Madam she threw in
quickly I am afraid I ought not to speak so disrespectfully of your
son Forgive me

The ayah after a long searching glance said no more and they devoted
themselves to putting Madam back into bed and bringing her supper
after which she submitted with evident pleasure to be read to sleep

By the time she was soundly in slumber it was still earlyabout nine
and Olwen thought it too soon to go to bed Taking her candle she went
down to the banqueting hall in which each day since her arrival there
had been a fire and lights in the evening As she opened the door a
sudden gust blew out her candle in spite of its protecting shade She
paused in the open doorway fascinated by the spectacle of the great
hall in moonlight

The snow without made the effect singularly brilliant Each mullion of
the great south window lay in velvet blackness across the floor One
casement of the oriel was open which was the cause of the draught which
had put out her light She closed the door noiselessly behind her and
stood enveloped in the complete silence of the vast empty place To her
right the closed door of the chapel seemed as though it might open at
any moment and disclose the figure of the chaplain turning from his
prayers to seek his bed in the tiny stone chamber in the wall

Picking up a shawl from some wraps on the settle she folded it about
her and crept up to the oriel seating herself upon the window seat
Outside the moonlit snow was so wonderful that she forgot all else in
its contemplation The tops of the trees were like snowy peaks of some
distant range upon which she looked down from an immeasurable height
As she leaned out she could form some idea of the madness which had
seized the unhappy girl who plunged into that underworld of mystery and
gloom There was an eerie fascination in it It did look as though one
might hurl oneself clean into eternity by merely letting go

There came the notion that all life is effortis holding on is
resisting the temptation to fall

How simple how curiously simple to cease that effort Words of a hymn
she had sung many times in church ran mockingly in her head

 Oh could we but relinquish all
 Our earthly props and simply fall
 In Thine Almighty Arms


The words had always formerly seemed most inappropriate for the singing
of a general congregation among whom scarce a dozen had any such
aspiration Perhaps Lily Martin had really felt it Was it after all
an aspiration or was it a temptation of the devil Simply to fall 
simply fall

The snow without was hypnotising heror perhaps some emanation from the
soul of her who had agonised there in that very spot was exercising a
malign spell She was so absorbed so utterly carried away by her
fancies that she did not hear the door open nor the low choked cry
which Ninian gave as he came in

He crossed the floor in a dozen hurried strides My God

She heard that She had been leaning out over the sill but she drew
back suddenly and herself uttered an exclamation on realising the
presence of someone in the dark behind her

Who is it she cried sharply and a voice replied

Its INinianwho are you in Gods name

Who should I be but myself she said in commonplace tones the
influence of the solitude and the entrancing night fading as she heard
her own voice and his

He laughed unsteadily Jove but you gave me a fright What in the
name of all thats arctic are you doing there

Is it cold I believe it is she replied rising I had forgotten
all about it because fairyland is outside the window

What on earth made you come here in the cold and the dark

I wasnt thinking I expected to find it warm and lighted as usual I
opened the door and then it was so weird I had to come in Isnt it
 but there is no word to paint it I am going to enrich my language
by a new adjective I must find a word to express this Pele But a word
wont do ityou must have a long cumulative effect of builtup words
like the poem of Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came  I wonder if
it was moonlight when he got there  Nobody knows what he found do
they But I know what I think

She was talking at random to give him time because she could hear him
breathing short and knew that the sight of her leaning out there had
been a shock He had at first taken her for someone else

He answered her a trifle jerkily What do you think he found

I think it was all glorious within There was nothing to do him any
harm The danger was all in the getting there Once arrived he had a
splendid welcome

I like that idea But come away Let us talk of it by the fire
downstairs

I think I wont come down It is almost bedtime and I am tired after
my walk Good night

As she took his hand she could feel his arm vibrate as with some very
strong emotion which he could hardly curb You have odd fancies he
said half impatiently I sayIm sorry I was such a bear at
suppertime

Oh you realise it then

Of course I cant think how I could behave so when only yesterday I
promised to reform

But you must sometimes be out of spirits she reassured him lighting
her candle as she spoke If you and I are to be friends we must make
allowances for each others moods must we not You will have to make
your peace with Sunia though I warn you she is much displeased with
you She seems determined that you and I should be friends doesnt
she

Do you think its possible we ever could he asked wistfully almost
humbly

Why not

Youreyoure so unexpected somehow I never know what you will do
how you will take things

Isnt that more stimulating than if you always knew beforehand what I
should do or say

Well of course it is

Perhaps a little friction is what you need she laughed as she took
up the candle and escaped




 CHAPTER XVII

 BALMAYNES WARNING


In the marketplace of Caryngston Dr Balmayne met the vicar a sturdy
rosyfaced man with a face like a jocund choirboy

Hallo was the clerical greeting How have you been keeping all this
awful weather Going to thaw though now

Pretty well replied Balmayne who had stopped his car to purchase a
keg of petrol at the local store Get in and Ill put you down at the
vicarage

Nothing loth Mr Lomas took his seat beside him He was a sociable
person always eager for news and with the exception of his vicarage
full of nurslings the doctor was his only associate at least during
the winter months

One of the best and most simpleminded of men he had nevertheless a
curious taste for horrors and found his keenest enjoyment in perusing
the detailed reports of murder cases in the daily papers or unravelling
the tales of Arsne Lupin Sherlock Holmes and so on A collection of
true stories of celebrated crimes passionels related by a wellknown
author had lately delighted him and he began to talk of it almost
immediately

You know Balmayne it is positively unsettling to read a book like
that he said The thing it brings home to you is that people are
hardly ever what they seem Picture to yourself a young girl living in
her fathers house simple dutiful giving up an undesirable lover at a
word of parental entreaty engaging herself most suitably universally
esteemed among even the strict Presbyterian circle she moved in and she
turns out to be

Well what does she turn out to be

To have been secretly the mistress of the man she professed to have
given up and furthermore to be his murderess

It was never proved against her was it asked the doctor

It was not and there were many at the time in Edinburgh who believed
her innocent but she was convicted of enough even without the murder
She was shown to have been without moral sense Fancy a young girl who
could engage herself to a good man while all the time concealing that
engagement from her paramour to whom she was continuing to send
passionate letters Isnt it inconceivable

I should have thought to a priest as to a doctor there is very little
that is inconceivable This world is an odd place and there are odd
people in it

Youre right there and talking of odd people Mrs Askwith has just
told me quite an exciting piece of news though I expect you have heard
it She says that the Guyses have at last engaged another girl to go as
companion up at the Pele

Yes your news is no news to me Vicar I was up there two days back
and am going again today as Mrs Guyse is not quite the thing

And you have seen the young lady

And I have seen the young lady

Indeed Indeed And how does she impress you

Very favourably She seems all right so far They have told her
nothing about Miss Martin

Ah um The vicar made little ruminating sounds as he turned this
over in his mind Talk of mysteries he remarked at length there
my dear Balmayne is a thing to puzzle you As queer as anything in
this book staggering though some of these undoubted facts are Will
that affair ever be explained do you suppose

I dont think there is much mystery there What is it that strikes you
as so mysterious

My good fellow we have discussed it a hundred times The girls
departure the way the thing was hushed up

It seems fairly clear to me as I have always told you Young Guyse
pays the girl to keep quiet

But why Why should he do so

Because he didnt want her to talk of course

Then you really think

Mrs Baxter told me that all the time she was delirious she kept on
repeating to herself Lily Guyse Mrs Guyse There is no doubt that
he had promised her marriage there was a weddingring round her neck
All that story of the ayahs about her getting letters from London was
concocted They said she burnt the letters and I never saw one or
heard of anybody except the ayah who saw one If the thing had come
into court the postman would have been called and it would have been
exposed but you see it did not come into court Of course Sunia
would swear that black was white in order to screen Guyse an utterly
untrustworthy witness His mother knew I am convinced of that

His mother knew

Undoubtedly She never liked Ninian but she has hated him since then
I fancy she would have taken the girl back on her own termseven as
Ninians acknowledged wife She liked her well enough and her life
since she was alone has been anything but amusing Guyse has the
impudence to declare that he does not know where the girl is and has
never heard of her since she left But that is a bit too thin No in
my opinion it was a lucky thing for that young man that poor Miss Martin
didnt succeed in her attempt an inquest would have been embarrassing
But the hush money is evidently a drain upon him He ought not to be so
frightfully hard up as he evidently is He makes a clear profit on his
farming and they are not without means though they lost a big amount
Well his dismal experience may have taught him wisdom He will be the
less likely to start philandering with Miss Innes

It seems to me an imprudent arrangement remarked the vicar in a
troubled voice Here is a man who cant afford to marry at all unless
he marries a fortune They import into that lonely house a girl young
and presumably attractive but so poor that she must work for her
living What else is there for Guyse to do but flirt Shut up with her
day after day it must be hard to help it

But what can one do said Balmayne musingly Would it be possible to
warn her I think she is a girl of characterquite a different type
from that other If she knew what sort Guyse is she would be safe
enough

Then I am inclined to think you ought to give her a hint I dont like
it Balmayne

Its so hard to say anything at all without saying too much

It is I see thatand you are a young man yourself If Wilfrid were at
home I could speak to him but Ninian is the kind of chap who thinks it
clever to be rude if you say anything he doesnt like

Wilfrid was a good deal cut up by that Lily Martin episode

No wonder A nice thing to come back from Klondykewhere he had really
been risking his life to mend the family fortunesand to find out what
had been going on in his absence Of course they hoped that as the
girl got well and departed nothing would come out But it didit did

Inevitably I suppose replied Balmayne but I can honestly say it
didnt get about through me

Who told the Kendalls said the little vicar shrewdly My wife is
certain that Rose Kendall meant to marry Ninian It was practically a
settled thing and Metcalfe told me she has thirty thousand pounds

I suppose Wolf is not likely to be coming home just yet

Cant possibly come as long as Parliament is sitting He took a few
days leave at Christmas you know

Now if it were he with whom a girl was thrown every day and all day
long warnings would be fruitless remarked Balmayne smiling Any
girl alive would fall in love with Wolf if she got the chance

If I were to write to him suggested the vicar tentatively Of
course I dont mean ostensibly I do write to him from time to time
Say I am sending back the book he lent me and am interested to hear
that his mother has a new companionthat her presence will do much to
wipe out unpleasant rumours or memories eh

Do you think that he doesnt know of the new arrangement then

I cant say

It was by his advice that they tried the plan before said Balmayne
thoughtfully He may have urged it afresh when he came home at
Christmas and saw how depressed and unwell his mother was A pity he
didnt insist upon its being somebody middleaged But I suppose he
thought that might be more depressing than nobody at all

Well if you get a chance concluded the vicar as the car stopped at
his gate I should put in a word but be careful The Guyses are a
very old family and this old blood does curious things Generally a
bit mad these highbred thinblooded chaps

You surely dont call Mrs Guyse blueblooded She ought to have
imported a good sane middleclass strain to replenish the old stock

Ah true Will you come in and see Ada

No thanks Ive got a pneumonia case and I want to get up to the Pele
this afternoon Mrs Lomas all right I hope

Yes yes capital When Ive finished Celebrated Murder Mysteries
Ill lend it to you went on Mr Lomas in a burst of friendship but I
havent read it all yet However bear in mind that nothing is really
improbable The young lady at the Pele cant be too careful I dont
know why exactly but I shouldnt care for a daughter of mine to be
there Ive heard it said that Mrs Guyse is a bit queer in the head
since their financial crash and the foreign woman is almost the only
servant they have Safe or not it cant be comfortable there for a
young lady it really cant

Miss Innes seemed all right when I saw her last However I will make
particular inquiry today When the weather breaks you must make an
effort and take Mrs Lomas to call at the Pele Ill motor you up
Poor old Reed the vicar of Guysedale wont be able to get there for
months

A broken Reed eh said Mr Lomas and the doctor glided away leaving
him chuckling at his own joke Like most people with no sense of
humour the vicar dearly loved a joke

Upon reaching the Pele that afternoon the doctor was shown into the
banquetinghall

The master of the house sat smoking by a good fire and the furniture of
the room was in some disorder as if in process of rearranging The
greeting Balmayne received was less hostile than usual though it could
not be described as cordial

Thanks my mother seems much better Convalescent in fact Ill let
Miss Innes know that you are here He went to the door opened it and
clapped his hands Then he was heard telling the ayah who had answered
the summons to say that the doctor had arrived

Miss Innes appeared at once and invited Balmayne to Madams room He
was altogether satisfied with his patient and quite willing that she
should be brought downstairs if it could be managed

When they had left the sick chamber and were passing through the
adjoining sittingroom he said to the girl I should like a few
minutes talk with you

She stopped It had better be here then said she in a low voice
for on the stairs or in the hall we shall be overheard The Hindu
woman cannot be cured of listening behind the arras I think she looks
upon it as part of her duties However she can hear nothing through
this door

He hesitated What he had to say would need some adroitness in order
that it might sound not too serious yet important enough to be heeded
He felt it impossible to begin

He smiled To blurt out what I want to say in cold blood is not easy
yet I think I may be sorry afterwards if I have failed to give you a
hint

Yes Her heart throbbed apprehensively

Have you heard anythingI think you told me that you had notabout Miss
Martin

She flushed but her answer came swiftly Thanks Dr Balmayne but
since I last saw you I have heard what I suppose to be the whole story
andand shall you think me wrong if I say that I feel it a subject which
does not concern me and which I ought not to discuss

I shall certainly think you wrong in the sense of being mistaken he
answered quietly In my opinion the matter does concern you What
young Guyse did once he may do again Of course that sad affair may
have taught him caution but it does not seem to me fair that you should
not be put on your guard

You think Mr Guyse was to blame she asked as indifferently as she
could but by the glance the doctor gave her she knew that he was
disagreeably surprised

So you are already a partisan he asked with a smile taking up his
hat

Olwen coloured surprised herself at the desire to champion Nin of which
she could not but be conscious You jump very swiftly to conclusions
said she steadily My point of view is that as I do not mean to remain
here there is no need for me to pry too closely into the Guyse family
records She added with a smile Mr Guyse recommended me to hear
your side of the story He said I was to put yours and his together and
see what they came to But please I think I would rather not The
knowledge of what befell my predecessor is enough warning it seems to
me

She broke off for a sharp tapping at the door announced that Nin was
outside With a shrug of her shoulders and a backward glance of
amusement she went and admitted him

Well whats the verdict May I bring her down he demanded entering

Oh Balmayne pulled himself together Mrs Guyse Yes certainly I
think so

Wait a minute just let me give the finishing touches cried Olwen
hastening back into the sickroom

Mrs Guyse was sitting well wrapped up in an armchair Her eyes rested
curiously upon the girl Been having a talk to the doctor she asked
expressionlessly

Yes but Mr Guyse is inconsiderate enough to interrupt He is so
impatient to get you downstairs that he has come up to fetch you Now
the comb for a minute Your hair has got rumpled There now you are
quite beautiful If I just put on your shawl

Mrs Guyses features twisted themselves curiously She was like one
overcome by an access of remorse Dont let yourself be taken in she
mumbled under her breath what do you suppose Nin cares if I am up or
down alive or dead

Olwen paused She was not certain of many things concerning Ninian but
she was convinced that he had a real affection for his mother an
affection daily wounded by her dislike of him

He doesnt like me to be upstairs because it takes you away from him
continued Madam with a spiteful smile You see you take a different
view of your duty from what Lily Martin did

Dont talk nonsense laughed Olwen She was so sure that Ninian was
in no danger from her own attractions that she could afford to make
light of the invalids malice Now Mr Guyse she went on throwing
open the door Madam is quite ready

Ninian went in lifted his mother carefully and brought her into the
sittingroom where Dr Balmayne was still standing Some unamiable
impulse caused the lady to give the doctor a cordial invitation to
remain to tea He accepted very readily and Olwen saw Ninians brows
contract as he carefully edged out of the narrow doorway in such a way
as not to inconvenience his burden

Madam complained a little as he moved slowly and steadily down the
spiral stair He made no reply but went on as though she had not
spoken finally setting her down in the glow of the firelight upon the
couch which he had brought into the house not two hours previously and
which Olwen had just covered with mattress cushions from the
diningroom supplemented with pillows of which Sunia had an unlimited
supply

Now said Olwen quite eagerly as they laid Madam down you must tell
us just how you like to be the back lets down or can be raised as you
wish Between them it was adjusted to her complete satisfaction
Ninian raising her in his arms while Olwen slipped the back rail into
its appropriate niche Balmayne stood watching the domestic intimacy of
the scene and his thoughts were grave

Mrs Guyse was evidently pleased with the new arrangement As they had
placed her she could not see the oriel window at all The high back of
the settle screened it from her and a little table stood conveniently
beside her for her endless knitting

Sunia now brought up tea and Olwen poured it out

Fancy said Madam to Balmayne Miss Innes reads aloud so well that I
quite enjoy it I always hated to be read to but the story she is
reading is so amusing that I am quite longing to hear the rest I have
been thinking about it all day and it cheers me up

Thats the very thing you want said the doctor heartily Miss Innes
will do you more good than my medicine

Yes but I am afraid she is not going to stay replied Madam with a
wrinkle of her brows

Rubbish broke in Ninian she only said that because I ragged her and
she got a bit riled However Im a reformed character now and I run
her errands like Marys lamb Been to Raefell station and back today
already for my lady

Thats right boast said Olwen scornfully Shall I put an extra
lump of sugar in your tea a reward for a good boy

Put it in my mouth insteada reward for a good dog he answered
grinning till the whole of his splendid row of sharp white teeth were
displayed

The demon of coquetry which sleeps in every woman prompted the girl to
fall in with his mood just because of the presence of Dr Balmayne She
laid the sugar on his sleek black head her finger upheld Trust
said she absurdly He sat immovable his eyes long and eloquent under
halfclosed lids fixed steadily upon hers Paid for she cried in a
hurry and he jerked his head caught the sugar in his hands and ate it

The finger flavour he remarked is excellent and very noticeable
What is that stuff which Sunia uses in her ministrations Subtle but
quite perceptible

Youre atrocious she said with a spurt of anger swiftly neutralised
as she caught his merry eye That is I suppose you are behaving as
well as you can so we must make allowances

He turned to the doctor Miss Innes is beginning my education he
said I feel sure itll take longer than a month dont you agree




 CHAPTER XVIII

 VISITORS


During a whole fortnight nothing particular happened but many things
took place the first of which was the passing of the snow By the end
of January it was all gone the trees in the ravine were black instead
of white and the roads while the thaw lasted almost impassable

Madam speedily recovered her usual health and Dr Balmayne paid only
one more visit on which occasion Miss Innes was out so he did not see
her

The state of the weather made farming impossible Ninian went hunting
once or twice but was for a great part of the time short of occupation
and Olwen and he were much in each others company

Reading aloud became a recognised amusement This took place usually in
the interval between tea and supper The rearrangement of the
banquetinghall and the comfort of the new couch had apparently
reconciled Madam to the renewed use of the one stately apartment which
she possessed She reclined beside the fire with her knitting while
Ninian sprawled upon the settle smoking and netting a new tennisnet
for next season Olwen between them had a little readinglamp all to
herself

Madam like her son was a creature of moods She puzzled Olwen At
times it seemed as though she were on the eve of a burst of confidence
Sometimes but very rarely she permitted herself a spiteful sneer at
Ninians expense as on the occasion of her first coming downstairs but
for far the greater part of the time one would have said that she
tried persistently and at times quite openly to throw her son and her
companion into each others society

As for Ninian his temper varied Sometimes for a whole day together
he would be perfectly delightful saying and doing nothing which
jarredmaking fun teasing preserving the demeanour of a big indulgent
brother who took increasing pleasure in the society of a small sister
After such a day Olwen would drift upstairs to her nights rest in a
happy dream She attempted no self analysis in these times She was
content with life as it was Then would come a day when Mr Guyse
hardly spoke when his brow lowered and he either avoided her or seemed
anxious to pick a quarrel This did not often happen and when it did it
disturbed her a good deal One morning she received a letter and a
parcel both from Ben Holroyd His firm had just been experimenting
with a new substance as an equivalent for silk and as a result they
were putting on the market some particularly charming sports coats in
all shades Ben said that he had given two of these dainty garments to
Gracie and that she had begged that Olwen might have the like This
gave him courage to venture upon sending them You are Gracies
friendher almost sister he wrote and you have no brother You may
find it impossible to be my wife but dont be unkind enough to say I
may not be your friend

Olwen felt it would be ungracious to refuse the gift thus offered in
truth it was very welcome since one needed warm clothing at the Pele
while the weather continued so severe Graces hand was clearly
discernible in the choice since both the coats sent harmonized with
skirts in Olwens possession One was a dark cold blue not in the
least what is known as navy but something like a starlit sky in
summer With a lawn collar and a skirt to match this looked extremely
nice and she went down to breakfast wearing it in high good humour

It was damping to find Ninian plunged in a fit of the sulks of which
she could not trace the origin

By next morning he had more or less got over it but Olwen did not feel
prepared to go back at once to the old footing She was a little stiff
and he went off after breakfast in something of a huff and did not as
usual return to lunch

Madam and her companion now on most amicable terms ate together Then
the lady was tucked up comfortably on her couch for her daily nap and
Olwen went upstairs to write letters She was thus occupiedBens
letter open before her her own reply nearly completewhen Sunia came
in a little breathless and very eager

My Missee change her frock quick said she people come acalling

Why Sunia how marvellous How unheardof I feel all of a tremble
laughed Olwen as she rose No wonder youre excited Things like this
mustnt happen too often or they will upset my nerves

Sunia was swiftly taking from its drawer Olwens prettiest frock and
one that she had never hitherto worn at the Pele for want of a suitable
occasion The ayah admired it greatlyit had been purchased for a
friends wedding the preceding summerand now she dressed her missee in
it with great satisfaction though in feverish haste

Missee go down quick poor Madam not like having folks allylone

Well I would have gone down at once if you hadnt insisted upon
dressing me up you silly old thing laughed the girl Who are the
visitors

Kendall folk said Sunia in a slighting voice You never seen em
they never see you She gave a little chuckle as if at some thought
which pleased her They see you this day certinly Miss Rose Kendall
she see you quite well There now here my Missee clean hanshifrun
away I must go and bring tea

Olwen took the hanshif one of her best and as she scuttled
downstairs she inhaled its faint exquisite perfume described by Ninian
as subtle yet perceptible She never gave a thought to the open
letters on her blotter

With Madam she found three strangersan elderly lady and gentleman and a
girl of about her own age The gentleman was fierce and military the
lady nondescript and uncertain the girl struck her rather unpleasantly
She was of the chinless type with a salient nose giving to her profile
the look of a bird of prey Her brown eyes were goggling but she
apparently considered herself a beauty for she was extravagantly
arrayed in ermine and velvet with diamonds in her ears and at her
collar

Mrs Guyse looked relieved when Olwen entered Ah here is Miss
Innes she said let me introduce herMiss Innes General and Mrs
Kendall Miss Kendall

The attitude of all these three persons when presented to Madams
companion was stiff to the point of rudeness but Olwen set to work
bravely to do her duty and entertain them as well as she could Mrs
Kendall turned her back addressing herself pointedly to Madam and the
General followed her example so Olwen gave her attention to the young
lady

I expect you came in a car said she it is the only way to get about
in these parts As we have not one we are almost confined to the
house except when the snow is deep and hard enough for sleighing How
far have you come

About ten miles said the heiress frigidly

Mrs Guyse took cold sleighing went on Miss Innes unperturbed she
was laid up for several days and it was all that Dr Balmayne could do
to get to us This place seems like the worlds end does it not

Miss Kendall stared forbiddingly It is one of the sights of the
country said she It is mentioned in Domesday Book

I was not criticising but merely commenting replied Olwen amused
As a matter of fact I like the solitude though I am surprised at
myself for saying so I came from Bramforth

Indeed was all the reply vouchsafed and the speaker looked out above
her furs so curiously like a parrot that Olwen nearly laughed

Wont you take off your stole This room is so warm we are obliged to
keep up the temperature for Madam

I am not too warm replied Miss Kendall with an indescribable arching
of her skinny throat

No its not a parrot that she is likeits a vulture thought Olwen
I can fancy her hopping sideways after a bit of carrion I should like
to see Nin deal with her Aloud she made one more effort

Do you live in the Caryngston direction

No replied the vulture and made no further conversational attempt

Olwen felt greatly inclined to say Oh very well sulk if you want
to but at this painful instant the door opened and the master of the
house walked in She was so pleased to see him that she actually gave
him what he would have called the glad eyereceiving in return a flash
of green light which gave her a queer sensation of pleasure They had
had a tiff and to both this exchange of looks seemed to say that all
was right once more between them

The lookeron thought she detected some embarrassment or
selfconsciousness in the cordiality of the greeting the young man
received from the General and his wife but Miss Kendall became a
different creature at once With much play of eyes and tossing of furs
she made way for him upon the settle at her side Olwen had risen at
once upon his entrance and the appearance of Sunia with the tea gave
her occupation at some little distance so that she could not hear what
Nin was saying only that he was making Miss Kendall laugh Her high
titter resounded through the lofty chamber But when Olwen rose and
began to hand round cups he instantly rose also took possession of the
cakestand and did his duty as host in a manner which pleased Olwen
enormously

Your ayah is wonderful said Rose accepting her cup I always think
she is immortal like She in Rider Haggards story She never seems
to grow any older and she lends such a bizarre touch The contrast
of the feudal fortress and the Oriental servant

Whats bizarre teacher asked Ninian of Olwen with a wicked look

Bizarre is the word which describes the effect of Sunia in the Pele
as Miss Kendall has just told you replied Olwen rather saucily
perhaps but she had been a little nettled by Miss Kendalls
illbreeding

Sunia is so devoted in her attendance on your mother that I should
hardly have thought you required anybody else went on Rose her eyes
fixed disparagingly upon Olwen

Oh it isnt Miss Inness job to wait on my mother said Ninian
quietly It was curious that Olwen knew his voice inflections well
enough to be aware that he was angry Sunia is all very well in her
way but she has her little tempers She was getting a bit unbearable
when Miss Innes arrived but she has somehow contrived to tame her
entirely Ayah is perfectly devotedwaits on you hand and foot doesnt
she He spoke standing up with his cup in his hand close to Olwen
determined that she should be included in the conversation She had
never liked him so well His mother chimed in

Yes as I hear Ninian telling your daughter it is a most remarkable
thing the way my ayah has taken to Miss Innes It was almost
instantaneous She positively worships her Miss Innes tell General
Kendall about the table

Olwen smiled as she related how she had wished to have a writingtable
in her room and how owing to the impossibility of carrying furniture
upstairs Sunia made Baxter take off the legs of an unused table and
transport it to the top of the house where it was put together again

Rose Kendall made no comment but after an insolent stare at Olwen
turned her shoulder to her and said to Mr Guyse How strange that it
never occurred to me to wonder how the things were got into the rooms
This fine billiardtable for example

My father never went without anything he really meant to have replied
Ninian This place had been more or less uninhabited for a century
except by a farmhind when he determined to use it as a shootingbox
He took out all the mullions of that great window and the table was
hauled up with ropes and pulleys

How glorious to own such a place said Miss Kendall fervently How I
should like to live in a historic tower

Ninians grin over her head at Olwen showed that he thought this attempt
too clumsy even for Miss Kendall Nicer to think about than to put in
practice he replied Ask my mother

Oh the Pele is a bit trying if you have to live in it in winter but
it has its good points said Madam Her voice had wholly lost the edge
of bitterness with which she had spoken of her home to Olwen as this
accursed spot

Miss Innes became acclimatised very quickly went on Ninian to the
young lady

She acknowledged the remark with a smile that was almost a grimace and
changed the subject forthwith What news of your brother He was
looking so well when I saw him last

Oh hes all right but we havent heard very lately This is just the
busy time for him Parliament opening and so on He sat down beside
the visitor and spoke with his eyes full upon her and an especially
demonlike smile By the way I heard a bit of news this morning Came
home hotfoot to tell Madam What do you think Mother Noel Guyse is
going to be married to Miss Leverett of Leveretts WashWhite
SlickSoap

Never Nin cried Madam with a little laugh His lordship has never
given permission

If he didnt hed be a raving lunatic Shes got money enough to buy
the whole county Now theyll have another try to get me to sell the
Pele See if they dont

But you wont cried Miss Kendall in terrified accents clasping her
jewelled hands and gazing at him intensely Certainly he looked
wonderfully handsome as he sat there so completely at his ease with
the impish smile flickering over his face

Depends on how much they offer he said with another glance at Olwen
For some reason which she could not fathom he was evidently enjoying
this conversation I suppose you had already heard of the engagement
he went on addressing the General pointblank

The old gentleman cleared his throat and admitted a trifle nervously
that he had heard something of it Met his lordship on the bench on
Monday

Did he seem pleased Ninian inquired

Oh ah yes certainly Very pleased Charming girl so he said
Case of love at first sight on both sides

No doubt said Madam with her little nervous laugh Love of money on
his side love of a title on hers

Ha ha Good my dear lady good laughed the General His daughter
added

Ive seen Amanda Leverett she was at Danley Races last autumn but I
forget what shes like Her clothes were all right They were the
thing you remembered about her

Well no doubt Caryngston can do with the money None of our family are
what Nin would call coiny said Madam

Ah but you dont need it you have something worth far more cried
Rose with a glance which she meant to be very expressive Ninian
acknowledged the compliment with a merry bow

Mrs Kendall rose She had been looking decidedly ill at ease while the
latest topic was discussed The days are so short she murmured we
must really say goodbye Charmed to find you at home and looking so
well dear Mrs Guyse Now I suppose it would be of no use to ask you
to let Mr Guyse bring you to lunch with us one day next week She
bent over Madams couch coaxingly

Oh no thank you I shall not go out until the weather turns really
fine was the quick response Miss Innes will have to do my social
duties for me

Mrs Kendall ignored the hint entirely Mr Guyse you will have to
take pity on us and come alone said she playfully Shall we say
Monday Or would Tuesday suit you better What with our having been
abroad the two last winters and in London during the season we have
seen nothing of you lately

Must be three years since I was at Copley isnt it

Oh I cant believe that it is as long as that How time flies But
do beerforgiving and come over for an hour or two The General is
longing for a chat with you

Cant be done thanks all the same Were shorthanded on the farm
and next week is going to be very busy The long snow has made us all
behindhand You must realise that Im a mere British workman not fit
to lunch with the quality

Rose approached laying her cheek down on her big white muff and
looking wistfully at him He stuck to his refusal however in spite of
entreaties The discussion seemed to amuse Madam She lay listening
with one of her queer lookslooks which enabled one to glimpse a passing
likeness between her and the son who was so unlike her

The young man accompanied his guests downstairs and as the sound of
their footsteps and voices died away his mother turned to Olwen

Dear How funny said she

What in particular was funny inquired the girl coming to relieve her
of her empty cup

The Kendalls Ha ha I cant altogether explain how funny it is but
I can tell you part They tried hard three years ago to marry Rose to
Ninian Shes got a nice little fortune it wouldnt have done badly
Then suddenly something made them think that they might get hold of Noel
Guyse Caryngstons boy and of course they thought that would be much
better They havent been near us for ages and when they walked in
this afternoon all gush I couldnt make out what brought them But
you see Ninian knew They had got wind of Noels engagement and hoped
we shouldnt have heard about it Hoped they wouldnt be seen through
But Nin wasnt going to let them off Did you see the Generals face
when Nin made him own that he knew Dear me I havent been so amused
for a long time

Nin was soon back again and came into the room laughing Well he
said arent those people just about the limit Like their cheek
turning up here and coming the longlost brother over me when theyve
boycotted me for three years

Oh well I think you scored said his mother with relish

What dyou think of em eh Teacher he continued dropping into a
chair by her teatable and stretching out his long limbs

Sit down and have a proper tea said she instead of replying You
were behaving so beautifully that you had not time to eat

Yes wasnt he said Madam unexpectedly Your manners are improving
Nin did you know

The expression which crept into Nins face touched Olwen with a quick
thrill of pity His eye gathered light his lips curved the colour
mustered in his dark face Evidently his mothers praise was delightful
to him

Of course however he replied flippantly Ought to be improving by
now Been living in a reformatory for weeks

Oh said the girl quickly has it been as bad as that

He gave her a sidelong glance watching the effect of his words Its
been very painful He sighed But all is forgiven if the result
seems to be worth the sacrifice You havent answered the previous
question Teacher What do you think of the resident gentry as
exemplified in the Kendall family

Oh  I expect they improve on acquaintance likelike some other
folks I know

Now what have I done for you to be nasty

Said youd been living in a reformatory she snapped

Ah but this one is run on the new linescure by kindness I like
being here so much that Im going to stay as long as they let me have
the same teacher

Doesnt he want shaking said Olwen to Madam

My dear I think you have shaken himpretty thoroughly




 CHAPTER XIX

 A DISCOVERY


Olwen was very busy For the last fortnight she had devoted herself to
the library and it had been a far more laborious business than she had
anticipated The books seemed to have been snatched from their places
thrown in a pile on the floor and taken thence and thrust into shelves
quite haphazard

Not only was there no classification but even the volumes of the
different sets were divided and had to be hunted for

She had by dint of steady work made considerable progress though
still there were rows of books lying on the ground carefully shielded
from dust by newspapers

This morning the sun was streaming blithely in through all the windows
and the sharp frost made one feel buoyant Olwen was in vigorous health
Since she left the Palatine Bank she had improved very much in looks
The tints of her face were like a sunwarmed peach her eyes were bright
and clear and the excellent feeding made her plump though the exercise
she took kept her from growing stout She sang as she stood upon the
library steps garbed in a blue overall with duster and feather brush
It seemed to her that all was right with the world

The upper shelves were devoted to fiction and she had just hunted out
and found the last volume completing a set of Bulwer Lytton She
carried them up to their destined shelf and was carefully arranging
them according to their numbers when one dropped from her hand into her
lap The leaves fell apart and a photograph slipped out from between
them Seated upon the top step she took up the portrait and studied
it

A young lady with ebullient hair teeth and a smile She wore a large
feathered hat and a lowgenerously lowevening dress with a rose at her
bosom and a diaphanous scarf over one shoulder

An actress thought Olwen and sighed a little pitifully for the big
bistred eyes were wistful and the lips so evidently carmined had a
pathetic droop She turned over the cardboard and saw words scrawled
across the back in a thick heavy hand

Ninian from his Lily

Beneath this which was written in ink the same hand had added
something else in pencil Mrs Ninian Guyse

To her own surprise Olwen coloured hotly She sat down abruptly on the
top step studying the pictured face intently

So that was the kind of girl he tried his hand upon last No wonder I
puzzled him No wonder that he didnt exactly know where he was with
me  This was Lily Martin How could they engage such a person How
could they have her in the house No wonder Sunia said she was not
pukka

Sitting there chin on hand she caught sight of her own reflection in
the glass of the opposite cupboards A small person in a long plain
overall almost childish nunnishly garbed from throat to foot

Then again her eyes sought the flamboyant image upon the cardboard

From that to this she thought with a curled lip

Her puzzled eyes staring out across the room fell as they often did
upon the family motto carved above the Tudor chimneypiece

Guyse ne sait pas se dguyser

Like many old mottoes it seemed ambiguous Did it mean that once a
Guyse you could not cease to be a Guyse nor persuade anyone that you
were anything else Or did it mean that any Guyse would scorn to stoop
to deception Or did it mean as Ninian vowed it did that a Guyse was
such a hopeless fool that any attempt to disguise or mask himself was
sure to be found out

She had herself inclined to the first interpretation Once a Guyse
always a Guyse would have been her paraphrase

Now she looked upon it with a curl of the lip She was recalling
Ninians telling of the story of Lily Martin The recital had seemed to
her to bear the stamp of truth Today her mind had received a nasty
jolt

She and Ninian had come farvery farsince their first meeting Only
last night the question of her remaining at the Pele had been
practically decided Ninian had expounded the rules to her If you
wanted to leave at the month you should have given warning at the end of
a fortnight Miss Now you have been here six weeks you will have to
give a months warning after this month is over we shall engage you
annually as they used to do the farmhands at Caryngston midsummer
fair

To this she returned that it seemed better that she should at least
remain long enough to finish the library catalogue and to celebrate
that decision Ninian at supper had bade Sunia bring a bottle of
champagne in which they all drank each others health

Mrs Guyse on this occasion looked more animated than Olwen had ever
seen her and Sunia when putting her missee to bed later had cooed
over her like a triumphant mother over a newborn child

Now this photo lay on her lap and the sight of it was affecting her
strangely

For weeks past she had hardly given a thought to the warnings of Deb
Askwith or Dr Balmayne She had not continued to keep Nin at a
distance In truth this was a difficult feat when Nin desired to
approach although looking back she realised how cautious the approach
had been

 How exactly had they reached the stage at which now they stoodthe
point at which two people have a common stock of jokes and memories a
common association of ideaswhen they turn to each other with a
certainty of response an assurance of mutual understanding

She could not tel Ninian the impertinent boor of the Seven Spears
had become her comrade she might even say her intimate friend It was
almost like necromancy

And now there lay before her this flimsy outofdate bit of pasteboard
with its costume of four seasons ago so frail and worthless a thing
yet able to give the lie to her own opinion of Ninian Here if looks
might be trusted was a girl of the cheap variety and yet to judge
from her expression not a vicious girl not a temptress She had lived
in the house with Ninian for more than a year Some quality in her
expression in the appeal of the big round eyes hurt the spirit of the
girl who gazed

He had told her to leave and she had wept upon his shoulder  How
many times during her stay at the Pele might she have used his shoulder
as a refuge without being repulsed Olwen shuddered There was an
element of horror in her thoughts

Was this man using her as a plaything Did he still think of her as he
had done of this predecessor of so different a type

No wonder that his first impression when he went to meet his mothers
new companion had been that of disappointment She had not seemed to
promise the kind of sport that he desired Yet her very aloofness her
snappish prudish ways had acted as a lure She had shown plainly that
he did not please her and he had determined that he would please her
Whether or no he found her attractive he was resolved that she should
so find him She professed not to be interested and he became
determined to arouse her interest

How long would it be before the pleasurable novelty of the situation
wore off for him Olwen clenched her small ineffectual fists She had
been very arrogant had believed herself so strong that such a man as
Ninian Guyse could not matter Now all unaware she found that she had
reached a point at which he did matter more than she cared to think

Her wounded vanity found some comfort in the reflection that from first
to last there had been no lovemaking They had become friends upon her
own terms She had as it were made the rules It was now up to her to
see that he kept them Surely she could do this Yet the revulsion of
feeling in her was so strong that she feared it must be apparent to him
She had believed his story of the Lily Martin affair In his mouth it
seemed to her to bear the stamp of truth Its disproof was in her
hand

 She recalled Balmaynes curled lips as he said So I see that you
are a partisan already

The doctor had attended Miss Martin he knew much more than Olwen could
possibly know of the matter She wished that she had allowed him to
tell her his version It had not seemed to matter then Now she would
give much to have Ninian cleared

If he and she were on bad terms she felt that she could not stay at
Guysewyke This certainty gave her to some extent the measure of her
own feeling She caught a glimpse of the long road she had travelled
and saw for an instant the strength of the cobweb bonds which knitted
her silently to this uncouth place and its inhabitants

She sat on the photo in her hand lost in these uncomfortable
speculations humped up on the top of the steps absorbed in gloomy
thought

The distant door swung back to let in a piercing sound of whistling
Nin and Daff precipitated themselves into the room with violence and
the young man shouted gladly

There you are after all Been looking everywhere for you My word
you do seem busy

She did not change her posture but turned her gaze down upon him as he
stood below smiling broadly up at her his teeth gleaming the sun
catching the pale metallic gleam of his eyes changing from green to
shot gold where the iris touched the pupil and making him look as she
often thought like an animal The same sun was shining richly through
her own hair so that she looked down upon him from a halo

Seeing that I told you at breakfast that I should be cataloguing all
the morning its not very complimentary of you to forget it so soon
said she disagreeably

Hallo Got the hump I should think so perched up there all these
hours You look like a saint and talk like a shrew Dyou know its
lunchtime

No I didnt Ive been so busy

You looked it as I walked in You were sound asleep I believe Now
come along down to me Ill jump you

He stood at the ladders foot his arms extended But yesterday and
she would have jumped into them Today she felt that she would rather
die

Oh do get out of the way said she you make me nervous These
steps are rickety Stand aside please

Oh come Teacher Dont go back to last month in that discouraging
way I aint done nothink fresh ave I Aint ad the coppers arter
me these three weeks swelp me I aint miss Tell yer strite I dont
move from this ere till I gets yer Come Moight as well jump first
as lawst

Oh please Mr Guysein worried accentsdont be silly Stand on
one side and let me come down

He gave her a long keen look then moved aside and stood still with
heightened colour while she replaced the photo in The Last Days of
Pompeii rose upright and deposited the volume in the shelf next its
fellow Then she descended slowly backwards reached the ground and
shook the dust from her overall before unbuttoning it

Are you in earnest Have I dropped a brick of any kind he asked in a
totally changed voice a voice which caused her to feel an insane desire
to be friends

Oh no only one does get so tired of that everlasting ragging she
replied slightingly moving towards the door

He moved more quickly than she and laid his hand upon the iron ring
which raised the latch His colour had faded and he looked so white
that she halted a little frightened

Dyou think its fair he began and broke off Sorry youre put
out he then said Dont know what its about Anyway its beastly
disappointing I had come to tell you such jolly good news The ice is
bearing you know Ive been over this morning to see

Surprise stayed her retreat Ice I didnt know there was any waterI
mean any water you could skate onhereabouts

Its some miles awayHotwells Lough said he pronouncing the word as
they do in NorthumbriaLoff Quite near the Roman Wall you know The
ice is like glass

Olwen drew a long breath If she loved one thing it was to skate From
the time when her uncles taught her upon the ornamental water in
Bramforth Park to the Christmas holidays when Ben Holroyd had taken her
and Gracie some stations up the line to the Great Stang it had been her
greatest winter joy Need she deprive herself of that joy simply
because she had determined after all to keep Muster Nin at a
distance  There was not much skating in the neighbourhood and
there would be others thereperhaps Dr Balmayne

Are you thinking of going over she asked

Not today its too far If we go we ought to start tomorrow morning
after an early breakfast and take our lunch with us

Near the Roman Wall said she waveringly

Quite near really Near the best bit of all

Well said Olwen half relenting well hear what Madam says I must
just run and wash my hands

With these words she disappeared and hastened up the newel stair Nin
stood motionless for some seconds after her departure then softly
closing the door he ran up the ladder steps passed his hand along the
shelf and took down The Last Days of Pompeii

The book fell open in his hand and he saw the photo He stared at it as
in a passion of disgust Then he took it up hesitatingly and turned it
over His brows contracted into a portentous frown as he saw the
inscription His mouth puckered itself into a whistle as if of sharp
surprise

The devil he said Oh the devil




 CHAPTER XX

 THE PHILTRE


Going to give myself a holiday tomorrow Ma and take Miss Innes
skating on the Hotwells Lough said Ninian when they were assembled at
their midday dinner Isnt that a good plan

Madam looked furtively first at him then at the girl as though trying
to surprise the expression on both faces The question seems to me to
bedoes Miss Innes think it a good plan said she

Olwen thus appealed to was in her usual difficulty She had learned that
Madam did not like her to say No to her sons invitations On the
other hand she was always very careful not to seem anxious to forsake
her duties and go off with the young man It had lately become the rule
for them to go out together of an afternoon since Madam still kept to
the house The skating was however to be a whole days expedition
Added to the girls doubts as to the propriety of spending so much time
in his society was the distasteful memory of the thing she had found
that morning She was diligently telling herself that it did not
matter Why should it matter She had never thought highly of Mr
Guyse The knowledge that he had grossly slurred the truth if he had
not actually lied in his account to her of what had passed between
himself and Miss Martin was simply a conclusive proof that she had been
from the first right to distrust him and that she must revert with him
to their former more distant terms since he might and almost certainly
would misinterpret her present attitude of friendliness

Friendliness Of course it was nothing more It could not be more

The most cursory consideration of the facts sufficed to show how
impossible a thing it was that the impoverished young master of the Pele
should contemplate marriage with his mothers companion

Rose Kendall had thirty thousand pounds Though her first attempt at a
reconciliation had been coldly received it was not likely that it would
be her last She was probably glad that her discarded suitor had not
been ready to jump down her throat but she would not for that reason
give up hope and by degrees her efforts must be crowned with success
To put it plainly the Guyse family could not afford to let thirty
thousand pounds go abegging

This being understood why should the knowledge of Ninians treachery to
one woman deprive another of a days pleasure in a life which could not
but be described as monotonous

Rather did it insure her safety since it must harden her heart against
the young scamps nonsense

These considerations all passed through the mind of Madams companion as
she gently replied I think the expedition will take too long We
should be too many hours absent

How did you intend to go Nin asked Madam Theres nowhere to put up
the horse

I know But Miss Innes is some walker My idea is to set out early
with a package of sandwiches and drive there taking Ezra with us to
bring the horse back We will skate for a couple of hours or soI should
think that would be long enoughand then eat our lunch and walk home
It is well inside ten miles the roads are in good condition and if we
start back about two we should get home to supper

That sounds feasible said Madam and I could spare Miss Innes if she
likes to go

Ninian looked at Olwen and seeing her hesitation insinuated what he
knew would be an inducement The Lough is only about half a mile from
the Roman Wall said he Theres a milecastle close by

Oh I have always wanted so much to see the Roman Wall cried Olwen
impetuously

And please Teacher you might continue my education by instructing me
a little bit about it put in the incorrigible meekly

Well my dear the decision rests with you said Madam in an odd
voice

Sunia was standing just behind her mistresss chair As Olwen raised her
eyes to answer she encountered the soft gaze of the clear
coffeecoloured eyes

She felt inclined to say straight out It is of no use your trying to
hypnotise me That being impossible she merely declared

I think I must stay at home and go on with my work in the library

Tell you what it is said Ninian confidentially to Madam Shes
afraid She thinks that if she spends a whole day with me shell
succumb to my fascinations and from the bottom of her schoolmarm heart
she disapproves of me

Everything is feudal here at the Pele was Olwens instant retort
We even keep a court jester

Madam laughed Shes a match for you Ninian

Is she said Ninian his bold eyes fixed fully upon the girl

Olwen did not change countenance but she could not meet his look His
previous words had had their intended effect She was not going to
funk as she put it to herself

You will have plenty of time for the library but the frost will not
keep observed Madam

Then if you approve Madam I should like to go Sunia let loose a
soft sigh of relief

When Miss Innes entered her room that night she knew by the weird
perfume that the ayah had been at her divinations The little pots
stood in the ashes and a faint blue smoke fragrant and making a
troubling appeal to the emotions lingered on the air

Oh Sunia in mischief again said she laughing as she came in

Sunia rose in her lithe soundless fashion and stood gazing upon the
girl Change coming she murmured Change in missees life A great
change Her wide eyes were mournful and she shook her head I not
see well this night she remarked a thing she usually said when her
incantations had not shown the desired result She fussed and petted the
girl beyond her wont that night massaging her limbs rubbing her feet
in anticipation of the next days walk She liked Olwens little pink
feet and often spoke in admiration of them When at last the girl was
tucked up in bed the ayah brought her a glass containing a small
draught of pale amber fluid

Whats that said Olwen sharply

Something ole ayah want missee take murmured the woman coaxingly
She added that it was a tonica strengthening draught which would
invigorate her for the morrows walk Olwen was very sleepy and
halfhypnotised by her toilet and by the mystic fragrance of the air
Yet the sight of that little draught gave a shock to her pulses and put
her on her guard

It was as though something or some one quite near whispered a word in
her earphiltre

Sunia had not said a word about Ninian but she had seemed depressed as
though she feared that things were not going right That she should
prepare a love potion was by no means unlikely

Not for worldsnot for anything that life might have to offer would
Olwen drink it Yet she felt that it would be wiser not to refuse it
openly

Thanks ayah dear Put it there I am going to read my chapter and
then I will drink it last thing before I go to sleep

Missee drink it now I wash the glass

All right I will Get me a clean hanshif please out of my
drawerone of those at the backunderneath

The moment the womans back was turned as she bent her head to search
in the drawer Olwen took up the glass resolutely She felt afraid but
knew she had but an instant in which to act With steady hand she
poured the drug away into an earthen vase containing flowers which stood
upon her bed table When Sunia turned she was holding the empty glass
tilted against her lips The single drop that passed them reminded her
of Chartreuse liqueur which Mr Holroyd had made her taste one New
Years Eve It was exquisite but fiery

When the woman had gone away she slipped out of bed and poured away the
tainted water from the flowers

Owing to the nature of the stairs and the difficulty of carrying pails
up and down each room had a kind of sink or semicircular stone basin
in the outer wall for the reception of waste water This enabled her to
dispose of the highly perfumed fluid and to wash out the vase with
disinfectant This done she lay down in bed trembling

Why should Sunia wish her to love Ninian The only answer that rose to
her mind was too horrible for her to accept The ayah had been
invariably good to her invariably respectful That she should be
seeking to compass her downfall was unthinkable Yet what else could be
her object

Olwen knew well that Sunia had the most exalted ideas of the rank and
station of her sahib and of what was due to him in the way of a wife
That she could deliberately wish him to marry his mothers companion was
preposterous Then it must be true that she desired the girl to fall a
victim

There came a sense of insecurityof suspicionof terror even There was
something uncanny in this place something unaccountable in these
people She ought not to have remained She ought to leave It was no
place for her Curled up in the downy softness of her bed the
firelight flickering upon the thick curtained walls and on the courses
of harsh savage stone visible above them she wondered how she dare
sleep in such a place Misgivings thronged upon her mindthe warnings
she had received the way in which Sunia spied upon her The idea that
she was a prisoner in the Pele stole over hera premonition that should
she try to leave they would prevent her

After a while calmer thoughts succeeded Such an idea as her captivity
was merely silly For what reason what conceivable reason should the
Guyses have designs upon her a young harmless powerless creature but
one as she reflected with satisfaction who had a home and relatives to
back her

Sunia was perhaps a little cracked having been born with the traditions
of the ayah trained for generations to wait upon almost to venerate
the conquering race In her lonely dull existence the coming of the
young girl had been an event It might have slightly disturbed her
mental balance Thinking back upon all Ninians eccentricity Olwen
could not recall a single word a single look of his which had suggested
vicious desires He had been impertinent even rudenever offensive in
that other sense He merely laughed at Sunia Madam also odd as she
was had never seemed to her to be morally delinquent Although the
confidence between them which her short illness had begun had not
continued since she was about again still Olwen had the impression of
friendliness of some amusement She thought she could say without
conceit that Madam found her likeable

By the time she fell asleep she was reproaching herself with folly
Sunia and Sunias tricks might be ignored Ninian had in fact offered to
tell the woman to let her alone She wished she had accepted the offer
Her refusal was based partly upon the feeling that things might be
uncomfortable in the house were the ayah her enemy and partly she
owned it with shame upon her own pleasure in being waited upon hand and
foot Until this devoted service began she had no idea how much it
would appeal to her So Spartan had been her upbringing that the mere
idea of personal attendance had a startling novelty Now after one
short month she was beginning to wonder how she would get on without
Sunias ministrations

 Well she had poured away the philtre 

 So that was all right 

She sank away into dreamland


Next morning when she and young Guyse met in the diningroom for
breakfast his breezy early morning manner made her ashamed of her
overnight panic Something in Sunias spells must she thought have
been responsible for such horrible thoughts

Admitted that Ninian had minimised his own blameworthiness where Lily
Martin was concernedwhat had that to do with Olwen Innes She had
assured him that it was no concern of hers

In the days wherein Olwen looked back upon this phase in her life she
wondered that she could have quieted her fears thus easily At the time
there seemed so many other things to think about

Ninian ground her skates beautifully and as she was particular about
this she had to watch the process Then there was lunch to pack into
his rucksack her own badweather coat to roll up and sling across her
back various small things to arrange before walking through the
courtyard and out across the Bulldrop to where Ezra stood holding
Deloraines head beside the dogcart

Ezra was told to get up behind the two young people settled themselves
comfortably and off they spun due south striking after a couple of
miles a good road leading right across the fells

The gay morning had made them both a little wild They hardly talked a
word of sense all the way to the Lough

Olwen had not expected to find this place so solitary It was she
thought the most desolate spot she had ever seen It lay in the lee of
a lofty almost precipitous crag standing up from the rolling fells in
dark ferocity No human habitation was in sight anywhere along to the
horizon

The road passed within a halfmile of the water and at the nearest
point they stopped possessed themselves of their skates and their
dinner and dismissed Ezra

The scramble over fawncoloured tussocks of grass with muddy ice
between proved enough to warm all their blood At the Loughs edge
Ninian adjusted first her skates then his own With a curt order to
her to wait till he returned he went coursing all around the surface of
the ice making sure of its trustworthiness It was absolutely safe
and he came rushing back his eyes sparkling with the joy of the rapid
motion

Simply great he said come along

In a moment she was up and they were off together hands crossed feet
moving in unison bodies swaying to the delight of it all The ice was
like black armour as Olwen said fantastically smooth except where at
the edges the withered reeds drooped their heads and made it lumpy here
and there

They were like a couple of children playing all kinds of silly tricks
First they wrote each others names with all kinds of flourishes Then
they did figures of eight following each others line of marks within
an inch or two Then rocking turns and finally waltzing round and
round

They had brought sticks with a view to the walk home and presently
Ninian produced a little ball out of his pocket and they played a kind
of hockey

It seemed impossible that the morning should have slipped away so
imperceptibly When Ninian proclaimed it to be lunchtime Olwen could
not believe it

Both were glowing with health and enjoyment as at last they came
reluctantly to the edge of the Lough removed their skates and looked
about for a good place in which to eat their lunch




 CHAPTER XXI

 BY THE LOUGHSIDE


There was nothing within reasonable distance better than the margin of
the pool Ninian spread his thick coat on the ground and they sat
down glowing with heat and with appetites sharpened by the keen air

I dont think I ever was so hungry in my life said Olwen

You look twice as fit as you did when first you came to us remarked
Nin A little blue thing you were with a red nose

Youre too complimentary

And now you are what Mrs Mountstewart Jenkinson would call a dainty
rogue in porcelain

What Have I ceased to be a schoolmarm and become a rogue

I think you will if we come skating often

And meantime you have left off being a tavern clown and become a court
jester

Thats a pretty thing to say

No worse than you are always saying to me Its mean to keep on
attacking and not allow me to hit back

Dont you like to be a dainty rogue in porcelain

I would far rather be a serviceable schoolmarm

You have been serviceable he said with a sudden change of tone The
change brought her heart unexpectedly into her throat It sounded as
though he were on the verge of becoming sentimental

Well of course said she hurriedly how could I earn a living if I
were not serviceable By the way you promised me a sight of the Roman
Wall Where is it I cant see it anywhere And what is a milecastle
Is it so called because it is always a mile away from the place where
you happen to be

The Wall is up on the top of that black cliff said he which latter
is known in the neighbourhood as Dukes Crag but thats supposed to be
a corruption of Crag Dhu the Black Crag No connection between the
Crag and any Duke can be traced

It wouldnt take us long would it to climb up there asked the girl
Is the milecastle behind

The milecastle is in that dip about a quarter of a mile to our right
But you mustnt expect to find either it or the Wall very high you
know The highest bit of wall remaining isnt more than eight feet I
believe and none of the milecastle is much higher than my head

Do tell me what exactly is a milecastle

There was one every mile that is every Roman mile along the wall
It was a little fort in which there was a garrison of about a dozen men
At each quarter of a mile there was a smaller one big enough to hold
two or three so that they were always near enough to call up their
mates in case of a surprise The milecastles were usually put just
where the lie of the ground needed a little extra protection

Excellent This is the young man who was asking for information about
the Wall from his teacher

He chuckled gaily Well I shall be delighted to hear anything you
have to say

Do let us go up and look said she impulsively This is the only
chance I shall have

Go to Why the only chance

Oh because I shall be leaving It is no use my staying here There
isnt enough to do I shall give warning as you call it next time I
get my wages

Then let us make hay oror anything else we want to make while the
sun shines he returned rising his lazy length and stooping to help
her to her feet

Can we go right up the rock she asked It seems a tremendous way
round

Yes the steep direct way is the best if you think you can do it We
can use my stick by way of a rope for you to hold on by Are you likely
to turn dizzy

No my heads all right

Then come on and lets chance it We must be pretty quick however
for we have not very much time to spare

The sky was blue the sun clear above their heads With their faces set
to the northern wall of the cliff they saw nothing of the black clouds
behind them

Olwen had never enjoyed anything as she enjoyed that dizzy climb
Ninian left off fooling and became a guide in all respects to be
desiredsteady competent and very strong

She followed his advice exactly and in what seemed quite a short time
he had reached the top swung himself into a sitting posture on the
verge and reached his arms to raise her to his level

Then quite suddenly when she had let go as he held her suspended at
his mercy he said in a strained voice unlike his own

Now say you believe me Say you trust me Do you hear If you dont
say so I am going to let you drop

She was used to him by now and not at all frightened Dont be an
idiot said she with the utmost calm put me down

Not till you say you believe me Say you are sure that I told you the
truth the real whole truth when I told you about me and Lily Martin
the other day

His face was close to hers his eyes looked right into hers They were
anxious but perfectly clear and bold She could not meet his glance and
tell him that he lied She tried to jest Any Guyse with green eyes
will tell

In a moment he had caught her in his left arm and with his right hand
covered her mouth to prevent her completing the quotation

No dont for Gods sake he said in agitation which she knew to be
real Answer me just once quite straight Do you think I would tell
you a deliberate untruth

Why should you Please set me down

In a moment This is awfully important Listen just a second I have
never told you anything yet that isntquitetrue Do you believe me

There was an appeal in his voice that shook her She knew that the fact
that he still held her in the crook of his arm shook her also

IllIll be far likelier to believe if you set me down and dont
bully said she still struggling for independence

He set her down gently upon the rock at his side What a little
featherweight you are he said absently then caught himself up with a
laugh and a glance of fun At it again But you know you really are
You always remind me of the Duchess in the Browning poem

 I have seen a white crane bigger
 She was the smallest lady alive

I suppose it is your Welsh blood that makes you so smallboned isnt
it

Welsh said Olwen in surprise How do you know that I am Welsh I
never told you

He coloured suddenly and deeply and for a moment foundered Oh but
didnt you tell Madam No Then it must have been your name Anyone
would guess you to be Welsh with such a name as Olwen

It is rather a giveaway said she wondering a little it his
confusion but attributing it to his realisation of the fact that his
remark amounted to an admission of his having thought a good deal about
her Im not so very short said she with dignity

He had taken out a handkerchief and was wiping her handsthose hands
upon which Sunia bestowed such carefirst one and then the other in an
absorbed way as if he disliked the least hint of earth upon them You
havent answered me he said after a minute but you do believe me you
know only you dont like to say so

How many times am I to tell you that I dont have any opinion about
you Youre outside my scheme of the universe altogether

That said he as he rose and helped her up is the merest piffle
as of course you know Come along if you want to see the old
milecastle It isnt much to look at When the weather gets better
well go to Housesteads and Ill show you the stone sills of the
gateway worn away with the driving in and out of chariot wheels which
were no more than a hoary legend to William the Conquerors Normans

Oh isnt it incredible she sighed The wonderful world

Hallo said he stopping abruptly and shading his eyes with his hand
Is this a snowstorm that I see before me Gee whiz we have got to be
quick

What do you mean Oh those clouds Why it will be ages before they
get anywhere near us

Dont you be so cocksure What a fool I was not to look at the
barometer this morning If I know my weather it is snowing like
Billyo at this moment in the Cheviots

Well I dont know how Billyo does snow so Im not impressed I see
a great broad worm wriggling up over the top of this height and
slithering off down the other side and I believe I do believe it is
the Wall itself My Wall

Oh Wall oh Wall oh sweet and lovely Wall echoed Nin with a shout
of laughter Yes there it is right enough and we can run along the
top of it if you like

In another few minutes they were both on the top running fleetly along
and gazing down at the vast natural rampart upon which great Rome
founded her artificial one

Youll have to do with the merest peep my lady and then I march you
off home cried Nin as they raced along What a goat I was to tell
you anything about it Theres nothing to see

Just to set my foot within the threshold and feel like Macaulays New
Zealander on the ruins of London BridgeRome shall perish Write that
word in the blood that she has spiltand now Rome is gone and we are
here

Yes he replied were here and thank God for that

They paused for they had reached the small quadrangular enclosure which
had once been a milecastle Here the proprietors had set up a bit of
iron rail designed probably to deter visitors from the favourite
pursuit of walking upon the wall itselfa process leading to gradual
disintegration They let themselves down into the castle and stood
within its boundaries

The site had been carefully excavated and its dimensions and plan could
be clearly seen It had once been divided like the upper floors of the
Pele into four small chambers each about twelve feet square Its
northern face was built against the Wall itself and there had been a
gateway leading through designed for foot passengers only On the
south side also there had been a doorway not very wide In the
southwest corner the farmer who now owned it had built up a small shed
or shelter using stones collected from along the Wall and roofing with
corrugated iron

Olwen was anxious to linger and make mindpictures of the garrison
seated round their charcoal brazier throwing dice as once they did in
Palestine at the foot of the Cross He began to describe to her the
rows of wooden huts and booths which grew up in those old days under the
sheltering Wall forming as it were one long town from east to west

So that one could buy toothbrushes and writingpaper and I suppose
postage stamps without travelling to Hexham or Newcastle said she
mirthfully

Then he glanced once more at the menacing north and urged her

Come For us today as for the old legions then trouble cometh out of
the north Let us get down from these dizzy heights and make our way
across the fell to the road I dont want to be caught by the snow up
here

He was turning in a different direction but she cried out that they had
better go down the short way He hesitated Its a bit steep down
there for you

But its much much shorter

He admitted it

Then let us scramble down as fast as we can You go first and then
you can find nice holes for my feet

After a moments doubt he gave in and they retraced their steps to the
place where they had made the ascent of Dukes Crag For some way down
all went well though Ninian was a little anxious having realised by
the slipping of a jutting bit of rock beneath his hand how keenly the
late tremendous frost had acted upon the somewhat loose and scaly
surface

Look out Teacher it came off in me and said he lightly and it
occurred to Olwen for the first time that she now understood that
nervousness always made him flippant

Perhaps her success so far had made the inexperienced girl a little
reckless She set her foot carelessly the ledge upon which she dropped
her weight gave and she slipped grasping with a sudden jerk at a
projecting lump above her head The lump detached itself with a crack
like a pistol shot and came down upon her flinging her upon Ninian
who just below had fortunately braced himself firmly to withstand the
shock

The loosened rock rushed on leaping down the slope and he heard it
crash dully upon the ice below

You clumsy little he began

Olwen neither moved nor spoke Her head was hanging over his shoulder
her limbs seemed to trail helplessly

Speak he said chokingly There was no answer




 CHAPTER XXII

 THE MILECASTLE


Olwen opened her eyes She was lying full length upon the ground and
it was very dark She could smell damp earth and for a minute she
thought she was dead and buried Her head swam and ached but she could
move her hands and she began cautiously to feel about her There was a
coat under her and some kind of pillow supported her head but she was
very cold She shivered and felt deadly sick What had happened

Mr Guyse she called sharply and when nobody answered she cried out
aloud in terror

All was very still she could not hear a sound With a dreadful effort
she sat upright and putting up her hand to her head found that it was
bandaged So dizzy did the exertion make her that she leaned sideways
unable to sit erect Her sore head found itself in contact with rough
stone She gasped in pain and fearfear of the black lonely silence
Leaning so she wept a while helplessly then made an attempt to rise
but was forced to lie down again abruptly

A hammer was beating in her brain thump thump thump It impeded
thought All attempt to remember how she came to be in her present
plight failed With the feeling that she was hopelessly defeated that
she could not struggle with pitiless circumstances she lay down again
and sobbed weakly the tears rolling down undried since she had
searched her pockets in vain for the handkerchief which should have been
there

Just as she was wondering how much longer she could bear her misery she
heard a slight sound like the lifting of a latch Then came breathing
and a footstep Ninian she cried affrighted

All right Im here was the reply and her relief took the form of a
new burst of blinding tears

She heard him moving vaguely cautiously but could see nothing He
seemed to be putting something down on the ground Then she felt him
approach Now he was crouching at her side There came the scrape of a
match and its flicker showed her his haggard face

Well youre alive he said and thats something you know

She struggled to keep back the tears Wherewhere are we she managed
to articulate His grin somehow reassured her

Where you were so anxious to find yourselfin the milecastle he
replied

The match died away and again utter darkness fell She had glimpsed the
narrow confines of the shelter which covered them

I expect you feel pretty bad His voice sounded anxiously beside her

Yesno Dont ask me she sobbed Im such a sillyfoolI cant
help it Illstop in a minute

Of course he said I know Never mind We shall do fine Im sure
Ive done the right thing Were safe inside the only shelter I know of
within three miles but the snow and the dark are both upon us Poor
little girl

Nnever mind It cant be helped I shall feel better presently

Sure thing Meanwhile he had found her hand and held it You are
as cold as a stone

She shuddered as she answered Yes

The trouble is that I cant light a fire The silly blighter who
designed this mansion built it without a chimney Ive been out in
search of fuel No wood to be found nothing but dead grass bracken
and thorns Its a bit damp and would smoke us out Im afraid if I
ventured to light it

Oh but we can go onsoon When I feelable

Nothin doin You could no more walk three miles against this storm
than you could fly in your present plight And in spite of what I said
about your featherweight I couldnt carry youat least not till Ive
had a good rest It was as much as I could do to get you up here I
dont know how I did it

Tell me she answered faintly but he replied

Presently when youre a bit more recovered Now Ive got a drop of
comfort Sunia put a thermos flask full of hot tea into my rucksack I
am going to give you a cup of that which will warm you a bit I have
my electric torch in my pocket but I fear it wont last long I know it
needs recharging Let me give you a hot drink cover you up as warmly
as I can and then Ill try and make Wades road to the south I might
perhaps find the TwiceBrewed Inn with luck

She cried out vehemently Oh no no I dont think I could bear to
be left Dont go Dont go You would not be able to find your way in
this storm andand if you were lost nobody would ever find me or know
where I am would they

He was silent He knew that for him to wander out into the now
impenetrable darkness with the storm rising every moment would be a
mad venture He had suggested it half because he thought she might
expect it of him or at least that she might feel more at ease if he
were not there It was an awkward situation but fortunately for the
man she left him in no doubt as to her own feelings in the matter Her
hands were clutching his coat he could feel the rigors that shook her
slight body

Dont be angry with me but you mustnt go Oh please dont go
unlessunless you think it is horrid of me do what you yourself think
will be best I dont want to be unreareareasonable

He took the groping hands and held them firmly To tell you the
truth he said quietly I believe that the best chance for you and me
to come through this night alive is for us to stay together At least
we are in shelter and if the snow gets piled up around the walls we
shall be more sheltered still We have some wraps and if two people
huddle closely together they are twice as warm as one would be alone

You rreally think so You are not ssaying so just to pacify me

I really think so you poor kiddie Now I am going to give you that
tea and we will have a few minutes light upon the subject

He fixed his torch and set it down upon the ground while he found his
rucksack and took out a cup and the thermos flask Olwen was so
unnerved that he had to hold the cup to her lips but when once she
tasted the tea its effect was almost instantaneous

Ah how good How good she murmured Now you have some too

Oh I dont want the muck said he Teas not my line you know I
wish I had a brandy flask here though

However she would not allow him to go without the hot drink he so
urgently required She would take no excuse and he saw that to refuse
would be to distress her cruelly He made a bargain however He would
drink if she would eat a sponge cake To this she agreed but found she
had promised more than she could perform He was glad to finish a few
sandwiches which they had left from lunch and found himself feeling a
little less fagged when he had done so

Their refuge contained nothing except a few sheets of corrugated iron
standing up against the wall one or two hurdles and a heap of sand in
one corner The sand was dry and soft

The snow without had already stopped the whistling draught which had
entered under the door A hiatus between the walls and the roof let in
plenty of air for ventilation He put on his coat which he had taken
off to cover Olwen when he went out to look for fuel Then he unrolled
her own raincoat which had been pillowing her head and wrapped her in
it taking his own overcoat up from the floor whereon he had spread it
Next he arranged some of the sand as a sittingplace for himself with
the main heap against his left elbow to serve as a support On this
heap he set his electric torch within hands reach Then he raised the
exhausted girl from the ground and carefully sat down with her in his
arms the arm which pillowed her head resting on the sandbank He
covered her feet with the grass and bracken he had brought in and drew
his own overcoat right over them both She lay as though in a cradle
and as his back was supported against the wall behind and he had
arranged the hurdles so that his drawnup knees would not slip he felt
that he could maintain his position for a long time without too much
discomfort

She gave a little sighing gasp as he settled her gently in his arms
She had closed her eyes for her feelings overwhelmed her He thought
her either asleep or unconscious

With a premonition that as the night wore on he might need light more
than he needed it now he switched off his torch The black stillness
enfolded the two of them This time however it was not the horrible
silence of desertion to Olwen for she could feel the pumping of that
vigorous and healthy organ which Ninian called his heart very near her
own ear

For a considerable while they sat in silence while by degrees a blessed
warmth stole over the shivering girl There was something most consoling
in the close contact Either the hot tea or the wrappings or the
current of sympathy flowing between the two was soothing the pain in
her head and making her feel more like herself Her voice coming from
the engulfing darkness made him start

I am remembering she said A bit of rock came down  and I fell
But we are not down but upI dont understand How could you possibly
get me up here

He laughed Ask me an easier one I simply dont know I clung there
like a stuck pig for a time which seemed like an hour to me with you
hanging across my shoulder like a sack of coals You were completely
unconscious and I was so panicstricken that I believe I laughed out
loud and long However after a time it occurred to me that I had
better get a move on and my mind began to work in a funny jerky
fashion First I thought it would be much easier to get down than up
and instinctively I acted on that belief and went down a step or two
in order to do which I had to move a little to one side Then I looked
below and caught a peep of the ice The rock you sent down had broken
it to shivers just exactly at the place where I should have to step I
know the lake is forty feet deep there and I thought if you and I
dropped in that would just about finish us Then I began to calculate
the chances of getting to any kind of shelter before it grew dark or the
snow came I couldnt think of any blessed plan Hotwells Farm is the
nearest and it is three miles if its a step All at once I remembered
this little cubby hole and I thought If I can only get her there I can
at least lay her down while I run and fetch help

Oh Im so sorry wailed a sad little voice from the regions of his
waistcoat

Why are you sorry Because I thought of this place

No but because it was my fault we went down the cliff You wanted to
go round

Shucks How could you know the perishing old rock would punch you on
the head Well when I thought of this place I saw that it was my one
chance but it meant going up and not down Then it dawned upon my
fuddle brains that I was much nearer the top than the bottom and
looking up from where I then stood I could see almost as though it had
been made on purpose for me a kind of a goat path running up sideways
Providentially you had draped yourself around me just in the handiest
way so I set out  I tell you it was nasty I shall be surprised if
they give me anything much worse to do in hell than that journey I had
to stop and rearrange myself and you afresh after every step I had to
crawl on hands and knees I had to keep wiping the perspiration out of
my eyes and the blood from your head kept dripping down on the stones
as I crawled and crept with one arm to steady you and one arm and two
legs to haul with Two or three times I said to myself Youre done in
at last But I wasnt I got to the top one day I think it was about
two months after I started and I laid you down

He stopped His breath was coming very quickly and the arms that held
her under the big coat tightened their grip Forgive me he
stammered

Forgive you she whispered faintly interrogative




 CHAPTER XXIII

 WHAT THE DAWN BROUGHT


When our lives come to be written in their true proportion it will be
found that in some cases a year has passed like a watch in the night
while some nights have lasted for years This is why the realistic
novelists who take pages to describe how a girl took a taper out of the
sideboard drawer and lit the gas are so pitifully mistaken When a
good cook takes a cabbage to cook for the pot her first action is to
strip and throw away the outer leaves as of no value The realist
seems to deal only with these outer leaves He does not hold that any
cabbage is ever cooked or if it is then it was not worth the cooking
Life in his estimation consists in the perpetual stripping of outer
leaves

The night in the milecastle marked an extraordinary epoch to Olwen
Innes When she looked back to it she felt that had not her senses been
so bemused there were certain deductions she must have drawn certain
conclusions at which she must have arrived

As a matter of fact all these things escaped her at the time she being
in no state to reason Yet the impressions left by what then happened
to her were so deep that afterwards she was able to think out the whole
thing justly

There were periods during that long waiting when her temperature rose
and she chattered a little deliriously There were moments when she grew
cold and sick and shivering fits assailed her Again there were
merciful interludes during which she slumbered heavily In all these
phases Ninian Guyse was close at hand to lay her down to ease her
posture to chafe her cold hands to hold her close in his efforts to
keep life in her

She did not know how in course of those dreadful hours he parted by
degrees with quite half his clothing to reinforce her flickering
vitality She had longish periods of something that was half sleep
half stupor and during these he rested He dare not risk allowing
their carefully cultivated warmth to escape by opening the door until
the last moment when they must make their final dash

After what seemed to her an endless period of darkness and pain and
everincreasing discomfort she felt that he was busily occupied in
fitting on her squirrel cap over her bandaged head and wrapping her fur
stole about her throat afresh

Are you awake Can you hear what I say he was inquiring in a voice
of dull patience

Oh what do you want Let me lie still

No you must get up See I have a cup of tea for you and when you
have drunk it you must try to stand and to walk a little We are going
out

She tried to resist these intentions on his part feebly whimpering as
she pushed away his hands He held on steadily repeating in a weary
voice Sit up Ill hold you You can sit up if you try There Is
that all right Now you must eat this before I give you the tea Come
be a brave girl Pull yourself together Were not dead yet

With a start she awoke to fuller consciousness She was sitting on the
ground propped against Ninian and his electric torch shed a light upon
them both She was past wondering whence came the tea or the bit of
stale spongecake which he put into her mouth as though she were a young
cuckoo She wanted the tea so desperately that she ate as he commanded
Then came the drink Having been kept all night it was barely lukewarm
but it was tea

When she had finished her guardian sat quite still for a few minutes
allowing her to recover Presently her faltering voice uttered some
pathetic little thanks

Come he said Thats more like you Now listen Its six oclock
and the sun rises before halfpast seven Theres hint of dawn now The
snow has quite stopped falling and I think we can strike Wades Road if
we make for the south Hotwells Farm is too far but there should be a
house of sorts within a mile or rather more from where we are in the
opposite direction and the lie of the ground is easier its down hill
Our only chance is to get there somehow The movement will keep us
warm Are you game

Ill do whatever you tell me came faintly Im sorry to be sucha
pig

A slight pressure of the arm which held her accepted her apology All
right then Im going to lift you to your feet Its just high enough
in here for us to stand up

He suited the action to the word Two or three billiard balls which
had been floating about in her head all night clashed together with a
horrid shock She hung limp against Ninian while she waited for the
resulting tumult to subside The perpendicular attitude seemed to
restore her scattered wits For the first time pride and a desire to
make the best of things awoke within her Up to that moment she had
been too badly hurt to care

Thatsbetter said she clearly II think I can get along Ill do
my best You are so good

Come on then he replied pushing open the door He said nothing to
Olwen of his struggle half an hour earlier with that same door

It had taken him twenty minutes to force it wide enough for his arm and
stick to operate upon the drift without in fact there had been a
moment during which he had feared that the weight was too great for him
to move alone In the end however he had succeeded in cutting a path
out through the doorway of the milecastle inside which the snow had
piled itself

Outside there was a more or less uniform depth of something more than a
foot Before them as they faced south the cliff so precipitous on
its northern face sloped gently downwards to the level of the old
coaching road that runs from Carlisle to Newcastle and is of late
years almost deserted

Not only was there a glimmer of dawn in the east but a belated moon
hung over this white and lonely world They could see quite well enough
to make progress possible but the distance was hidden Ninian wanted
to descry a house that they might make a beeline for it but they could
see nothing in all the snowy wilderness At last the girl spoke

Do you see that black little grove of trees to our right lower down
not quite so far as the road I should think

Yes I see where you mean

Isnt there something light against the black trees that looks like a
line of smoke going up

Jove the porcelain rogue has done it Thats smoke right enough
Theyre astir early enough over there Cheero partner We can hit
that clump of trees without having to take such a very steady aim
Better keep along the top for a bit in the lee of the wall the snow is
not half so thick there as it is just beyond

They started off and for the first few minutes the stimulus of the tea
and the sting of the high air revived Olwen surprisingly

What a blessing our coats hide some of the havoc observed Ninian who
upheld her by her arm I am nothing but rags underneath and as to you
the less said the better you are in a ghastly mess and I dont see how
I can so much as wipe your face for you

Is it all over blood she asked with such strong distaste that he
began to turn over in his mind the possibility of wiping it for her
Their handkerchiefs had all been requisitioned for bandaging and he
would not allow her to cut up her clothes After reflection he found a
convenient boulder brushed the snow from it and seated her thereon
Then without announcing his intention he cut away a bit of the sleeve
of his flannel shirt Having put a little snow into the tin cup he
thawed it by holding lighted matches under it

Then he sat down propped her head against his shoulder and washed the
poor soiled little face with the water thus obtained teasing her softly
the while with uncomplimentary remarks upon her features such as a
brother might have made

Oh thank you thank you she sighed You really are a dear You
are good to me

He made a queer little sound that was almost like a groan Looking up
quickly she surprised in his face an expression of misery which was
unlike any look he had worn before His eyes met hers in a beseeching
sort of way and he put up his hand to her face as if to hold her head
closer or to prevent her looking at him Then he uttered this
unlookedfor aspiration

I wish to God I had never seen you

At the time the words sounded incredible but on thinking it over
afterwards she was sure that he had used them She felt too stupid
however to ask him to explain They sat silent for a minute then
arose and continued their difficult pilgrimage

When they thought themselves close to the house they were stalking they
had a disappointment They came to one of those abrupt gaps in the
cliff up and down which the Roman builders carried their wall without
flinching This particular gap is extremely precipitous and getting
down was a long and difficult job By the time it was accomplished and
they found themselves in a boulderstrewn field they could see the
house plainly

Oh this is Hazel Crag where old Abraham Bird lives said Ninian
hopefully He is the oldest inhabitantmust be ninety or more He has
a daughter a sprightly young thing of seventy or so who looks after
him The old girl gets up bright and early doesnt she Anyway she
has a good fire and you can rest here and be warm till I bring the trap
for you

She smiled wanly for she was sick with pain Do I look so very
awful she asked with a truly feminine shrinking

I dont think old Mrs Barcombe can see what you look like he replied
encouragingly but in any case Ive washed your face for you Now a
long pull and a strong pull and well be in harbour in quite a few
minutes We shall beat the sun I do declare

Slithering and wading through the loose snow they reached the door of
the farmkitchen The blind was drawn and a glow of lamplight and
firelight showed through it As they stood awaiting an answer to their
knock the girl turned her paindimmed eyes upon the drear inhospitable
world wherein they had been so nearly lost

A faint glimmer premonition only of daylight showed vague whiteness
mist black trunks of trees that stood motionless at gaze in the now
windless air

It was like the vision of a clairvoyant not a moment in actual
existence The girls weariness and pain were interpenetrated by a
strange new thrill born perhaps of the contact of Ninians closely
folded arm

The call of the north she said to herself Sunia is really a witch
This is where I belong

The sound of a bolt being drawn from within made her turn quickly The
door was thrown widely open and Dr Balmayne confronted them

The revulsion of feeling in Olwen caused by his presence and his look
cannot be put into words He had his usual aspect of wellgroomed
neatness His blue eyes rested upon the couple outside first with the
blank stare of nonrecognition then with a depth of amazement which was
in itself a condemnation

Well said Ninian easily I do have the devils own luck Out of all
the world you are the man we want at this moment Balmayne Miss Innes
has had an accident

So I see said Balmayne mechanically speaking like a man overwhelmed

Ive come to ask old Abe for hospitality while I go and fetch the
sleigh and take her home said Ninian as he led the girl into the warm
kitchen where the fire blazed gloriously seated her in a cavernous
chair and kneeling before her began swiftly to unlace her wet boots

Old Abe died about an hour ago said Balmayne standing aside with
stony countenance

Ninian stopped short with a start then resumed his ordinary manner
That so I suppose youve been up all night

I came last night and couldnt get back

The storm was sudden said Ninian calmly He rose to his feet strode
out of the room and called up the stairs

Mrs Barcombe Mrs Barcombe

Why who be you said a quavering voice from above

Guyse of the Pele I got snowed up on the fell and Ive brought a
young lady here She had an accident May I leave her in your kitchen
while I go and get the sleigh to drive her home

Ill be doon verra soon Mr Guyse Im joost aputting the pennies
upon his eyes Poor old feyther he do make a handsome corp for sure
he do

He was a fine man Mrs Barcombe God rest his soul Well may the
young lady stay

Oo ay she may bide if she will She aint your sweetheart Mr
Guyseeh

Why what makes you ask that

You shouldna bring your sweetheart into the house wi a corp in it or
shell never wed you

Ill have to risk it old lady You come down and get the doctor some
hot water and clean rags will you

During this colloquy Olwen had sat with eyes closed and the doctor
stood staring upon her as though he had been turned to stone As the
talk went on he saw the girl shrink and wince and when Ninian came back
into the room she was sitting up holding the arms of her chair
shivering and shedding tears

What is it Youre not afraid to stay are you cried he explosively
going to her side

Miss Innes has no alternative put in the doctor curtly She is not
in a condition to talk in fact I doubt if she ought to be moved at all
I shall be able to judge better when I have examined her injury He
came a little nearer and stood looking at her How did it happen

Just by accidentthe frost she began and Ninian cut in

Never mind how it happened the thing is to get it mended as soon as we
can Im afraid its pretty bad but shes so plucky

Balmaynes lip curled Mr Guyse has singularly bad luck with the
young ladies who come to stay at the Pele said he as if he could not
resist the temptation to see Ninian writhe

The culprit did no such thing He stood there in the centre of the
kitchen as great a contrast to the other man as could be conceived

He was so dark that to go one night unshorn made a ruffian of him and
his cut hands torn clothes and tousled hair joined to the fact that
his cheek was green and blue with a severe bruise and that there were
flecks of blood about him made him seem as unsuitable a companion for a
nights adventure upon the fells as any poor girl could have been
afflicted with

He kept his selfpossession however He had just caught sight of his
reflection in the dim little mirror above the high chimneypiece and he
grinned as he sleeked his black head with both dirty hands

Ill leave her in your charge doctor said he easily Do all you can
for her and if the time hangs heavy before I get back you can always
amuse yourself by taking away the last shreds of my character

For a moment he stooped over the girl Keep up your spirit he
murmured Think of home and Sunia and nice white bedclothes

She gave him a wan little smile but the force she had put upon herself
to enable her to reach the farm had left her spent She was within
measurable distance of complete collapse

The moment the door closed behind Guyse Balmayne went into the
adjoining parlour and wheeled out a long horsehair couch Giving rapid
directions to old Mrs Barcombe who had come downstairs by this time
he secured enough pillows to enable him to lay the girl down easily In
a few minutes he had a hotwater bottle at her feet and having warmed a
little milk in a saucepan added a tablespoonful of brandy and made her
drink it before commencing his operations

The removal of Nins bandages revealed a more serious wound than he had
anticipated Investigation proved it to be superficial but it was
extensive enough to need a good many stitches As a matter of fact the
fur cap which the girl wore had deflected the course of the descending
rock and probably saved her life by causing it to strike obliquely A
bit of the scalp had been torn quite away from the bone which was
itself slightly scratched but not cracked as he ascertained with
relief

She was so exhausted that she lay almost torpid under his handling and
he accomplished the painful business of sterilising and sewing up the
wound with no greater sign of suffering than a few moans It took him
some time to unfasten her hair and it was with real regret that he
found himself obliged to cut away a long thick tress to clear the
ground for his operations

When the job was done and he had adjusted the lint steeped in
antiseptic lotion with skilfully folded roller bandages he gave her
more milk and brandy To his astonishment she had very little fever
but he expected considerable reaction that night when the effects of the
shock became more manifest

He covered her warmly and went away leaving her to herself while he
washed his implements in the scullery

When he came back her eyes were open and she murmured a few words of
thanks

Is the pain in the head less

Oh much less

You must have fallen a considerable distance

I did not fall

No

The frost had made the rock dangerous We were climbing  Dukes
Crag A bit of rock broke loose and fell upon me

This I conclude happened yesterday

Yes

Would it be impertinent to ask where you have passed the night

In the milecastle There is a little hut there I was unconscious
and the snow came on We could not get home

It seems incredible that Guyse should take you to such a place on foot
at such a time of year

We went to skate

Indeed Does Guyse usually skate up the face of a cliff

She smiled a little It was my fault we went up I wanted to see the
Roman Wall

He made no reply gazing into the fire and wondering what he ought to
say or refrain from saying

Her voice was heard after a long pause It can hardly be necessary for
me to assure you that our being out last night in such a way was sheer
accident

With a start he made some confused apologies I am perhaps intrusive
in saying even so much he concluded but I wish it had not
happenednot with that man

I might have agreed with you  yesterday she whispered faintly

He flashed a keen look Yesterday

But this morning I think  I am sure  there could not be a more
perfect companion than Mr Guyse for such an uncomfortable adventure

To this he made no reply for some time but at last as if he could not
withhold the comment he remarked A man would have to be triply a
brute had he been otherwise than considerate when you were so badly
hurt

She had no reply to make and they sat on silently in the warm kitchen
Old Mrs Barcombe trudged to and fro with deep sighs and some audible
speculation as to the difficulty of getting the corp to the churchyard
in such weather She invited the girl to go upstairs and have a look at
feyther an invitation which the doctor hastily explained that the
young lady was far too ill to accept

After an interval when they had the kitchen to themselves he said
quietly Am I to conclude that you intend to remain at the Pele

Why not she asked in sudden alarm What do you mean

A sound without had taken him to the window and he turned with a grave
face and the news that Mr Guyse had already returned with the sleigh

Oh I expect he met Ezra come to fetch us cried Olwen quite eagerly
Is hethe manthere too

Yes fortunately replied Balmayne coldly as he turned to her and
began to wrap up her feet in a voluminous red flannel petticoat
belonging to Mrs Barcombe and to secure this swaddling with a bit of
string

By the time that Ninian entered the room he had wrapped her head and
all in a huge plaid and without a word he lifted her in his arms and
stood looking at the other man across his burden

I conclude you will start for home at once he said If so I will
put Miss Innes in the sleigh Not a moment should be lost in getting
her to bed I have not written a prescription for her because it is
not possible for you to have it made up I will come myself this
evening and bring it with me Meanwhile ask Mrs Guyse to give her
some nitre if she has any to keep her warm and let her have hot milky
foodnothing else until I see her again

So saying he bore Olwen out of the room and the house leaving Guyse to
take farewell of Mrs Barcombe and remunerate her for her services

This was quickly done and as Ninian was snatching up his cap from the
table to hurry out and see how the patient was bestowed he saw lying
across the table a gleaming tress of hair The bulk looked soft misty
brown but all the tips which stood up and glittered in the light were
burnished gold He took it up folded it with care and bestowed it in
an inner pocket Then he walked out of the door with a devilmaycare
smile and noted with a curl of the lip that Balmayne had laid the
patient right across the front seat so that he would have not only to
sit behind with Ezra but to drive from that inconvenient position
However he had the justice to admit that if Miss Innes had to lie down
this was the only plan His own of holding her upon his knees would
in his mind have been immensely preferable




 CHAPTER XXIV

 THE FINAL WARNING


But little recollection of the drive remained afterwards in Olwens
memory She could recall only the moment when Ninian pulled back the
folds of the enveloping plaid lifted her and bore her into the Pele
The strait dimensions of the newel stair compelled him to carry her
upright and the pain of her head thus unsupported was severe

There followed only a confused impression of Sunias sympathetic hands
of being undressed tended and laid in bed After this nothing definite
for several days

The reaction which Dr Balmayne had anticipated supervened That
night her temperature rose and for some days she alternated between
delirium and weakness Her youthful strength however very soon
triumphed There was no symptom of pneumonia or any other bad result
from her exposure Her wound healed cleanly and rapidly and on the
morning of the fourth day after the accident she awoke to a normal state
of things

The room was warm with fire and gay with sunshine Her head no longer
ached and her mind worked clearly Sunia as usual squatted upon the
hearth

Oh Sunia she said suddenly what trouble I have given

The Hindu rose and came to the bedside with a pleased face Come
Missee get back herself said she cooingly All right so long as she
get well quick

I am well I shall ask the doctor to let me get up today

The ayahs face darkened a little at mention of the doctor Humph
First ting you speak of doctor sahib said she He not care how long
Missee stay in bed he allowed come up and see her English waybad
English way My country no let pretty doctor see memsahibs

Olwen smiled at the old womans talk There is so much news I want to
hear she said You must tell me all about everything First was
Madam very vexed with us Was she very anxious when we did not come
home that night

The ayah glanced at her sidelong Umyes She wonder if you safe and
warm She think you stop in the farm all a night

We hoped she would think that Now about Mr Guyse I hope he was not
ill afterwards She spoke as unconcernedly as she could turning away
her head

He get shocking bad cold Been two days in his bed Better now said
Sunia watching as keenly as a bird the colour that would flicker over
the averted cheek at the mention of Ninians name

I am sorry He was very good to me all that night I should have
frozen to death if he had not kept me warm

With a clothes off his back replied the ayah

Yes Now about my own people Did Madam write to my home do you
know Sunia

No Madam not write She not know what best to say Think Missee
better write her own self Doctor say dont frighten em Missee all
better in a little few days

Olwen felt grateful Now that memory was coming back she felt a keen
desire that the whole of her adventure should not be known in Bramforth

The intensity of this desire lit up the episode in an ugly light She
knew full well that she ought not to have set forth upon a days lonely
expedition with Ninian completely unchaperoned She recalled the
things she had written concerning him to Gracie Yet she had accepted
him as sole escort during the whole of a day a favour she would never
have dreamed of according to Ben who was a dozen times more reliable
She was greatly to blame and had a lively consciousness that this was
so The resulting disaster had been an accident but such an accident
ought not to have been possible had she been as circumspect as her
grandfather and aunts would expect of her

And now what came next

Her mind held two distinct ideas and they fronted her like
dangerboards She heard Ninians voice saying far more earnestly
than she had ever heard him speak I wish to God I had never seen you
 And she saw Balmaynes grave kind face his anxious expression as
he said I wish it had not happenednot with that man  and woven
into both these thoughts was a wild thrill a stir of the heart a
nameless sweetness which she could not banish

She was hovering once more in the tangle of doubt and fear in which
Sunias attempt to administer the love potion had cast her She felt
afraid to face Madam or Ninian Madam had not been to see her at all
and she could not help knowing that most people in Madams place would
feel considerable annoyance at such an escapade on the part of a girl in
her position

With renewed force the conviction that the Pele was no place for her
asserted itself But now she fought against the conviction She did
not want to godid not want to leave  what or whom

She glanced at the ayah knowing full well that those watchful eyes had
discovered her secret

Poor Missee said Sunia pityingly Ole Ayah saw it all that
nightnight before you go skating with the sahibthat you going to be
hurt going to hurt a head She not say no good frighten Missee But
ole Ayah never see wrong She sighed deeply lifting a little saucepan
from the fire and bringing to the girl a cup of such soup as Mrs
Baxter alone knew how to make

Her gentleness her sympathy were so seductive that Olwen was almost
ready to fling her arms round her neck and whisper that she loved the
sahibloved him and trusted him Almostnot quite The thought of the
philtre stuck in her throat What would have become of her in her
extremity that night in the milecastle had she swallowed the horrible
brew She shuddered as she thought of it

She knew that Ayah was waiting there pleadingly hopefully for her to
speak again of the sahibto give her some details of their adventure
This she was determined not to do In her mind was stirring an uneasy
wonder as to what she might have said when she was feverish She knew
that she had talked for there had been glimpses of sanity during which
she had heard her own tongue babbling and wondered who that was who
would go on chattering so disturbingly

She longed for somebody in whom she might confide But there was nobody
and she did not intend to write anything like the full story of her
accident home to Bramforth

She asked presently for pencil and paper and wrote a line to Aunt
Ada

 
Im sorry it is so long since I wrote but I have had a slight
accident It happened when I was skating I cut my head against a bit
of rock As a result I have had to go to bed for a day or two but am
now well on the mend They are extremely kind and I have a doctor in
attendance Ayah waits on me hand and foot I am much vexed at being
laid up as you may imagine and if I dont get well as fast as I hope
to do I shall come home for a week or two Can write more fully after
the doctors next visit but mind you dont worry I am quite all
right

 
When the doctor arrived that day she was for the first time eager to
talk

He sat down at the bedside and the ayah stood in the background with
the air of being blind deaf and dumb but as Olwen knew alive to
every word every look every smile that passed between them

Balmayne was as conscious as she of this fact He knew also that all
the Hindus ideas of propriety would be outraged were he left alone with
his patient but for all that he meant to have private speech with Miss
Innes

Sorry to trouble you Ayah he said but I must ask you to prepare
that hot lotion again for me

The woman rose looking malevolently at him listened to his directions
and slipped out through the arras to her own room where she kept a
small cookingstove

He followed and drew back the hangings saying quietly Too much
draught through these curtains I will close the door He did so in
spite of the gleam of hate in the old womans eyes returned to Olwen
with a smile and began his unrolling of the bandages about her head

Well Miss Innes he said purposely lowering his voice it is
strange how things settle themselves as it were accidentally A while
ago I was wondering how it would be possible to get you away from this
place and behold You have decided to break your head and made
departure inevitable

She turned quite pale as he noted with vexation Departure
inevitable she repeated in a startled voice Why

You wont be able to do any work for some time yet I shall have to
order you home but I thought there was no need to tell the Guyses as
much until we came within reasonable distance of the date at which I can
allow you to travel

And thatwhen will that be she asked faintly

Well let me see Today is Saturday I ought to have these stitches
out on Monday or Tuesday You could travel the day after or two days
after Yes you might leave next Wednesday or Thursday

Butbut I shall be quite well by then she stammered

No You will have to go quietly for some weeks No careering on skates
or in sleighs He smiled She returned no answer she was most
evidently perturbed Fresh air he went on is necessary and the
Guyses keep no car Now that the snow is gone the only vehicle you
could use is that dogcart which is most unsuitable

She laughed a little bitterly Do you think my grandfather keeps a
car You dont seem to understand that I am out to earn my living

I am speaking he said in the purest altruism and he smiled a
little ruefully Personally I shall be considerably the poorer when
you go Butwell I have sisters of my own and I know a girl of the
right kind when I see her I tell you I would not trust a sister of
mine in the house with Guyse for a week

Yet I have been safely in the house with him for six weeks she
countered swiftly

He glanced at the bandage on her hair shrugged his shoulders and said
Safely Perhaps safety is a matter of opinion

No it is a matter of fact said Olwen with a shaking voice As a
fact I am convinced that Mr Guyse would do nothing to harm me

The doctor stood a moment silent mechanically rolling a bandage between
his skilful fingers

Well he said slowly I must ask you to pardon my interference This
is the last time I shall speak to you on this subject It is a very
disagreeable duty and will probably be useless but I must clear my
conscience Were I in the place of your relatives I should argue
somewhat thus She was young and inexperienced and as innocent as all
good girls The only person who had a chance to warn her was the
doctor It was up to him to use his medical authority and give her a
pretext to slip out of the net

Olwens colour was brilliant But she expostulated if you
meanwhat you seem to meanthat Mr Guyse hasbad designssurely he
knows that I am not without a family and friends

He also knows that you are of age put in the doctor quietly I
should guess you to be a little over twentyone

I am twentythree

Just so Then what remedy has your family None whatever Anything
they might do would merely make public what they would wish to hide
Abduction is a punishable offence But this is another matter

She was outraged Oh Dr Balmayne wont you give me credit for some
selfrestraint some modesty Dont you realise that what you are
hinting could never be

It was his turn to colour and he did so I am aware that I am risking
your friendship even your toleration by speaking he replied
steadily I do know of course that this could never be except in
the one case

In the one case

Of his having succeeded in making you care for him

In the pulsating silence which followed this remark they heard the door
unlatch and Sunia brought in the bowl of hot lotion

The doctor took it calmly from her hands completed his treatment and
presently took his leave As he wished Olwen goodbye he added rapidly
in French Soyez calme Je ne vous redirai jamais les choses que jai
dit aujourdhui

Nothing at all passed between her and the ayah after the doctor left
All the rest of the day she was meditating upon what he had said She
could not but see that he honestly thought her in danger and as she
pictured to herself the next meeting between herself and the
incorrigible Nin she felt herself falter

She was no fool She knew that a girl does not think of a man day and
nighteven to be in a rage with himunless he has made a deep
impression

She wondered a good deal that he sent her no written message Each day
Sunia brought an inquiry from Madam and the sahib as to the health and
progress of the invalid This was answered verbally No note came from
the young man Was he her lover or not If he were not she knew she
could not stay If he were the doctor thought she ought not to stay

On the following day which was Sunday she sent down a written message
on an open morsel of paper Please send me up some light fiction

Half a dozen books came up but with no message She would not ask Sunia
how Mr Guyse was or what he was doing but as the woman moved about
the room putting it to rights she remarked First day my sahib gone
out He gone spend a day with Kendallfolk They pleased I thinking

Would not you be pleased too to have your sahib married asked Olwen
boldly hoping her colour did not change

I pray my gods all days for my sahib to marry was the simple reply
and that I hold his son in my arms before I die

Olwen rolled over and pretended to hunt for a handkerchief under her
pillow Well I hope you will have your wish said she tranquilly

The Hindu woman paused a moment to contemplate the enigma of the
European womans coldness Olwen nearly laughed the womans thoughts
was so plainly written in her face You must be an inhuman
shecreature was the unspoken word I gave you the most potent
philtre known to Hindu lore and still you are unawakened Still you can
talk of his marriage with another woman quietly I have been mistaken
in you




 CHAPTER XXV

 THE UNEXPECTED


On Monday the doctor took out the stitches and gave permission for Olwen
to sit up in a chair by the fire Sunia having been sent away for an
extra rug he turned to his patient and said abruptly

I was almost forgetting Here is a letter for you I went into the
post office to get your new tonic made up and Branson said Heres a
letter for the young lady at the Pele and as its a foreign one shell
be glad to get it before tomorrow morning if youre going up sir

A foreign letter said Olwen wonderingly I wonder who is my
correspondent abroad I know of nobody

New York postmark said he handing over the envelope Now I must
go for Mrs Kays baby is unwell and I promised Ezra to drive on
there Goodbye

He had made no reference of any kind to their talk of Saturday

Olwen held the letter hesitatingly wondering whether she should open
it Suddenly came a determination not to allow Sunia to know she had
had a letter Repeatedly she had been conscious of a suspicion that all
her correspondence was overhauled by the womanand she was Ninians spy

If she knew that Olwen had received a letter she would probably search
for it at the first opportunity If on the contrary she was unaware
of its arrival she would not be anxious to learn its contents

Although consumed with curiosity the girl therefore hid away the
foreign envelope with the name of a hotel in New York printed on the
outside A wonder was faintly stirring within her as to whether by any
chance her correspondent could be Lily Martin That young lady had
originally come from America so Ninian had informed her She might
have returned thither Were she and he still in touch with one another
Had he mentioned Olwen and had she determined to send the new love a
chapter of the private history of the Guyses

It was hard to wait in order to ascertain the truth of these exciting
conjectures Yet she forced herself to be patient until the hour at
which the ayah went downstairs to wait at table when she knew she would
be undisturbed Then she drew forth the mysterious missive from the
place where she had concealed it and prepared to satisfy her curiosity

The first words upon the sheet of paper within brought the blood flowing
to her face and caused her to catch her breath with a low cry of
amazement


Little daughter of mine have they allowed you to remember that you
have such a thing as a father He doesnt feel worthy to be called
anything so holy but he exists and the craving for you which he has
always kept stowed away in a dark corner of his heart has been lately
growing so large that he finds he has room in his life for little else

My child I am actually that which I used to declare myself in church
at the time when I didnt believe that I was anything of the kinda
miserable sinner In my youth I must have been potentially so For
very many years I have been actually so I have likewise suffered for
it Sometimes I have vague hopes that the suffering and the sin may
perhaps when God adds up the column balance one against the other
That is probably because of my ignorance and my egoism God He
knoweth

I have lived in such poverty and hardship that I have had to stifle the
longing I always felt for you Now however things are a little
better At the cost of health and a good many other things I have
scraped together enough money to bring me back to civilisation and to
prevent me from having to sponge upon the Wilsons

Has my daughter any memory of me any love for me Duty wont do I
want love for the few very few remaining yearsit may be only months
that we might spend together Knowing what I know of your training
your upbringing I feel it very doubtful that you can judge of me
otherwise than your poor mother was able to do And yet in the days
when I had you with mehad you and didnt know what it would be to feel
the miss of youI used to believe that you loved me as she poor soul
never did

When first I determined to write to you it was my intention to wait
here until I got an answeruntil I knew whether there was strong enough
reason for me to make the effort of the voyage to England But last
week an attack of illness decided me that there is no time to losethat
if I want to hold my child in my arms it is now or never

The doctors say I shall be ready to start in a fortnight from now I
have booked my passage on the Stupendous and am due at Liverpool
about the tenth of March If you can give me a welcome come to the
docks I shall look for you there and if I do not see you will drive
to the Columbus Hotel If you are not there and have sent no message
I shall know that you repudiate the man who for so many years has
grossly failed in his duty to you Dont fear that I shall blame you
All the blame lies on my shoulders I shall say as once I said after
the verdict in a Court House in the west of Canada The sentence just
passed upon me by the court is just God bless youYour prodigal
father

MADOC INNES


At the end of the letter appeared two spirited little sketches The
first entitled My child as I remember her showed a little girl in
very short skirts with thin black legs and long masses of flying hair
The second My child as she probably is now showed an
ultrafashionable young lady with hat of the newest tilt carrying a
parasol yet with a something in her carriage and general aspect which
did suggest Olwen

These little pictures brought tears streaming from the girls eyes It
was the first time she had sat up by the fire to eat her dinner and she
was still weak For some time she could not check her weeping although
its cause was chiefly delight

All unexpectedly Fate had come to the aid of Dr Balmayne She would
have to leave the Pele now Her father was to sail a fortnight after
the date of his letter Said letter had been through adventures It had
been sent to Gratfield her grandfathers old parish thence to
Bramforth thence to the Pele He would set sail as near as she could
calculate in three days time She could not reply to his letter he
would be gone long before her answer could reach him He was due to
arrive at Liverpool in about ten days time She could just manage it
If she left without notice she would have to forfeit her second months
salary No matter One months salary would take her to Liverpool and
enable her to stay there a night or two until the boat came in

She surrendered herself to the joy which the thought of her father
brought He had not forgotten her he had not been heartless She had
often pictured him as settled in some new country with a new wife and
other children on his knee She had wronged him there No one had
supplanted her in his heart illregulated though it might be As soon
as he had snatched out of the jaws of adversity enough to prevent his
being a burden to her family he was coming home to claim her They
would be together Delight surged up in her

Someone to stand by her to advise her to fight her battles What
would he think of Ninian Guyse

It was curious that the whole affair seemed somehow different when she
contemplated it with her father in the background How little as a
fact she knew of Ninian Guyse Dr Balmayne was a good adviser

Ah How splendid yet how improbable it sounded that in ten short days
she would be in her own fathers arms his most serious object in life
recipient of his whole attention Her future would be the one thing of
all things in the world which would interest him How glad he would be
that she had not married Ben She laughed out in her glee and was so
lost to all sense of time and place that she very nearly allowed the
ayah to surprise her with the letter in her hand A slight noise behind
the arras was the only thing which saved her

Sunia was in silent mood that night She put the girl to bed almost
grimly Olwen longed to ask how the sahib had enjoyed himself with the
Kendallfolk but refrained Just as she was leaving her for the
night the ayah remarked Dont be frightened if Daff bark in the night
Sahib not come in yet

Im not likely to be frightened said Olwen sleepily and she gave a
little laugh of childish exultation at the thought of her news her
letter her secret which Sunia did not so much as suspect  Yet as
she lay alone after the woman had left her she had a dull pain
somewhere in her heart for she believed that this day with the Kendalls
showed that the night in the milecastle had brought illumination to
Ninian also He had seen that he was following a willothewispthat
nothing could come of the friendship between them so oddly begun I
wish to God I had never seen you 

So he was going to erect barriers He was going to take Rose Kendall
to prevent him from making a fool of himself with Miss Innes

Olwen was honest and she knew that had he been engaged to Rose she
would never have gone out for a days skating with him She had then
hoped or expected something in spite of all her denials

What did it matter She had her father now

Next morning she sent a courteously worded note to Madam asking her
whether she could possibly exert herself to climb the top flight of
stairs and pay her a visit as the doctor would not let her go down and
she had something to say

She rose with the ayahs help and dressed by about twelve oclock
Soon after she was established by the fire Madam knocked at the door and
entered Her expression gave the girl a shock Olwen had supposed she
hardly knew why that her adventure with Ninian would not be likely to
displease Madam very much She had found her so laissezaller so
languid in her views that she had not anticipated severe condemnation
more especially as on certain occasions it had seemed as if their
intimacy were being encouraged Now she saw in a flash that she was
seriously out of favour Madam wore the look which Olwen had seen now
and then on her face when Ninian had opposed her will or she feared
that he intended to do so Her mouth was compressed her eyes stony

I trust you are better said she standing just within the door

Miss Innes sprang to her feet It is good of you to come she began
confusedly I have been wanting to see you I dont know what you
must think ofof my imprudence Im sorryoh I am very sorry that
itit happened

Madam gloomed at her very stiffly That what happened she
questioned

Olwen crimsoned Myaccident she said mumblingly sinking back into
her chair Madams attitude had put everything in a new light She
felt like the veriest culprit MrMr Guyse would have told you that
it was altogether unintentional

There was a bitter little smile Mr Guyse has not been too explicit
I had perhaps better hear your account of it

Olwens eyes filled She felt most unequal to a scene Wontwont you
sit down I can see of course that you are much displeased with me
II realise now that I ought not to have gone out with Mr Guyse as I
did but it was with your approval Madamindeed it was with your
approval as you must remember

Madam sat down as it were reluctantly upon the edge of a chair She
had somewhat the aspect of a most unwilling visitor in someone elses
house Really Miss Innes you have been two months in this family
Surely you cannot pretend to be ignorant of the fact that I and my
approval count for less than nothing with my son

Olwen swallowed tears of extreme mortification Then you thought all
the time that I ought not to go but never said so Yet I am in your
care and I am not very old or very experienced However perhaps
there is no need to go over the thing in great detail It shows that I
am not a suitable person for my position here and I will relieve you of
my presence as soon as the doctor gives me leave to travel I think he
said I might go on Thursday and this is Tuesday Iof course I can
only expect one months pay as I leave you without notice I am sure
it is what you would wishthat I should go at once I am grievedpride
had upheld her so far but here her humiliation broke down her voice
pitifullyyes indeed I am grieved to have been such asuch a failure
I meant to do so well

Madam twisted her mouth up on one side as she regarded the drying of the
tearful eyes I dont think my son has found your society a failure
she remarked with meaning

Olwen winced Was this deserved Had Madam all along blamed her
conduct thought her too free been censuring beneath that apathetic
manner Nothing whips and stings an innocent girl like the accusation
of bold conduct You think I deserve that she whispered
passionately

Do you deny that you have flirted with him asked Madam as if
surprised

Yes cried the girl flaming at the injustice of the ladys attitude
I have not flirted I declare that I have not  She meant to say
more but refrained She would not accuse Ninian Had he had the
baseness to represent to his mother that the advances had been hers

Come come there is no need for so much tragedy What has happened is
most unfortunateI conclude at least that you agree with me in
thinking so It was a deplorable adventure and the fact of your
encounter with the doctor at Hazel Crag made it a great deal worse But
fortunately you have to deal with a young man who perverse as he is
has nevertheless a great deal of good feeling You need not be so
apprehensive I am authorised to let you know that my son is quite
ready to marry you

Olwen stared Then she rose to her feet choking In her shame and
terror she could hardly speak

You meanyou mean that I am compromisedthat the only way out is for
Mr Guyse to sacrifice himselfto marry me she managed to bring out

Madams eyes surveyed her with a fishlike gaze What did you expect
she asked

Expect Nothing What should I expect I am here as your companion
and if I have been out with Mr Guyse I say frankly that his company
has been thrust upon methat you have actually thrown us together If
you have a spark of justice in you you must admit this

Well but you bewilder me Miss Innes I was under the impression as
my son certainly was that you had an affection for him and were
willing to marry him Had I not supposed so I should certainly not
have allowed you to go out for the day together I understood that he
meant to ask you to be his wife in the course of that day Did he not do
so

Certainly not Nothing of the kind He had no more idea of it than I
had II cannot think what you mean by talking like this Your son and
I owing to a quite unforeseen accident had to remain out all night
Nothing could be more scrupulous than the way he behavednothing could
be more complete than Dr Balmaynes understanding of the position And
even if he did not understand iteven if he did look upon me as
compromised what does that matter to me I am leaving this place on
Thursday and I hope I may never see or hear anything of any of you
again

Thank you that shows very good feeling said Madam icily I wonder
at you indeed I do Miss Innes I had supposed that I came to reassure
you I expected to find you in some mental anxiety and was desirous to
let you know at the earliest moment that my son admitted his
responsibility and had no desire to shirk it This will be a blow to
him

Oh I think he will get over it I can disappear as Miss Martin did
and you see this has only lasted such a short time it will not make any
deep impression As a matter of fact I should have had to leave in any
case owing to family reasons I heard from home yesterday and find I
am wanted at once

Again Madam smiled Like the young man at a dull houseparty you have
received a telegram summoning you away said she I happen to be
aware that the post yesterday brought no letters for you

No but Dr Balmayne brought one The chemist at the post office asked
him to take it with him when he came

Madam changed colour violently She could not for a moment control
what seemed like extreme annoyance For quite an appreciable time she
could not speak and Olwen sat contemplating the unexpected result of
her simple announcement and saying over and over to herself I knew
it They have always overlooked my correspondence What a mercy the
doctor happened to bring this one

Madam rose from her seat and went to the window After a minute she
faced round and said steadily

As long as you are here you are in my charge Before allowing you to
leave I intend to write to your grandfather a full account of what has
taken place I could not permit him to suppose me so careless of you as
to let you go out all day long with my son if I had not believed that
you were as good as engaged Before receiving you back he shall be made
acquainted with all the facts

Olwen half rose but sank down again and bit back the plea that rose to
her lips She felt as if she were in a trap running round and round
seeking a way out But there was a last appeal she meant to try She
did not believe that Ninian would allow her to be bullied or coerced
She could take her stand upon his sense of justice and honour Ah
but could she  Dr Balmayne who knew him far better than she did
thought otherwise She trembled with a sense of her helplessness

Madam saw that her last threat had hit the girl hard She stood
inflexibly awaiting a reply

Olwen threw up her chin and spoke bravely I shall appeal to Mr
Guyse she said I will insist upon his telling you himself that no
lovemaking has passed between us

Very good replied Madam at once I too think that you should do
as you suggest I will not write to your grandfather until I know what
the result of your interview will be If you could exert yourself so
far as to come down to tea in the banquetinghall it would save poor
ayah some of the running up and down stairs which during the past few
days has been almost too much for her

This parting thrust brought the tears smarting to the girls eyes

Madam looked round the room with an appraising gaze as she moved slowly
towards the door I dont think said she with a very faint smile
that you could truly say that you have not been comfortable here

OhIyouwhat am I to say burst forth Olwen vehemently I was so
happy I was growing to loveMadam turned swiftlyto love the old Pele
and the wild country and my life hereand now you have spoilt it all
Nothing can ever be the same again She grasped the arm of her chair
and leaned her brow upon her hands almost disappearing beneath the
overweight of her tumbling hair

Oh come things are not so bad as you think replied Madam in a
different tone If you marry Nin you would stay here always

Marry him because I have lost my reputation cried the girl wildly
lifting her tearstained face You must be mad to think I am that kind
of a girl

Madam shrugged her thin shoulders Well I shall expect to see you at
tea time she said and went out




 CHAPTER XXVI

 NINIANS TWIN


Missee fancy chicken for her lunch asked Sunia softly

Olwen shook her head miserably and mopped her eyes with her
handkerchief As the ayah saw the traces of grief she uttered a
pitying little sound and ran forward Olwen made a brave attempt to
speak and to control her weeping

Dont bring me any lunch please I have been working you to death up
and down stairs all day at my beck and call Never mind I shall be
gone in a day or two and then you can have a rest

The Hindu took the kettle from the fire poured out a little water
added violet salts and eaudeCologne and came to her chair

Dont you talk no words like those words said she under her breath
Her voice was rather like the very low growl of an angry animal Madam
say things like that she not pukka Madam not I sorry for she mother
to my sahib but she not pukka My dear lamb let ole ayah bathe her
eyes and not cry any more

The girl yielded herself up to the soothing touch telling herself that
it was very likely for the last time Ah could she but have trusted
this woman 

Madam had left her with her uncomfortable feeling of doubt more
accentuated than ever She was unable to guess why the Guyses had
determined that she should not leave the Pele Perhaps it was merely
for the conventional reason that if she did leave there would be
another scandal tacked on to Ninians shoulders That might be all
They might be desperately anxious to detain her until things had blown
over

Yet for two reasons she felt that she could not stay Her fathers
impending arrival was quite enough had it stood alone Added to it now
was the situation between herself and Ninian

This she could have treated lightly but for her selfdistrust Already
at the thought that she was to see him in a few hours her heart was
turning over her pulses racing She thought of his grave preoccupied
face as he sat holding her head against his shoulder and washing blood
from her face with a bit of his shirt as though she had been his little
sister and how he had put up his hand to her cheek covering her eyes
holding her a minute close pressed

She felt absolutely convinced that it could not be he who had sent the
insolent message brought by his mother at the very memory of which her
blood boiled He was ready to marry her he had no wish to shirk his
obligations

After that even without her fathers letter nothing would have induced
her to stay

Sunia fussed over her more than ever that afternoon as though in
deliberate defiance of Madams words She coaxed her to eat to rest
to compose herself and presently she set to work to dress her patient
and to arrange her hair properly for the first time since her accident

She had been very angry when first she discovered how big a tress had
been cut away as she stood today planning how best to conceal the
ravage she gave vent to several remarks disparaging to Dr Balmaynes
surgical skill evidently hoping to make the girls natural vanity an
ally against a man who had sacrificed her appearance

However she invented a new method of wrapping the hair about the little
heada method which hid the wound and proved very becoming She arrayed
her in the gown she had worn the day the Kendalls called and had her
ready a quarter of an hour too soon that she might rest by the fire
before the exertion of going downstairs

Ole ayah take dear Missee down now cos she got to go and bring tea
afterwards said she at last

As Olwen rose to obey her heart sank and her knees trembled She
dreaded the impending meeting unspeakably and yet mixed with the
dread was the mysterious flooding joy which would not be fought down

She sought some motive for Madams apparently senseless change of front
Had she during that night of adventure forfeited the respect of the
owner of the Pele Her whole mind rose to contradict the notion  but
how could she then account for his mothers insolence Something might
have happened must have happened since they last met She knew there
was something between herself and Ninand as she searched her mind she
was aware of having known as much for days past Otherwise he must have
sent some message some token of solicitude for her welfare

The ayah preceded her carefully down the stairs with a candle to light
her feet She was weaker than she had foreseen and came so slowly that
Sunia outstripping her had opened the door of the banquetinghall a
few seconds before she reached it Through the doorway there came
clearly the sound of a laughNins laugh but with something unfamiliar
in the tone and words followedof course if it were possible to muff
it you wouldjust exactly the same kind of ass that you always have
been

The entrance of Miss Innes cut the speaker short She stood just within
the door feeling that the fireside was a long way off steadying
herself for a moment against the wall

There were three people present Madam sat on the settle her face
transformed with a radiance which made her almost handsome Close at
her side was Ninian with an arm flung over her shoulders No it
was not Ninian Never had Olwen seen anything resembling an endearment
pass between those two Ninian with his pipe in his mouth was leaning
his back against the mantel and behind his shoulders the two carved
panthers upheld the Guyse coat while the light flickered on the words
of the motto Guyse ne sait pas se dguyser

Upon the girls appearance the young man who was seated sprang to his
feet Then she saw that his hair was fair and his eyes very blue He
was smilinga smile which was Nins and yet not Nins His teeth were
as regular but smaller There was nothing in his manner which at all
resembled the impudence of his twin

Is this Miss Innes he asked cordially and moved forward so quickly
as to intercept Nin had the latter cherished any intention of going to
meet the girl Olwen gave her hand in mute wonder found it taken
drawn under his arm while he piloted her with care to a seat Im
Wolf he said winningly as my people dont seem to think an
introduction necessary Have you ever heard tell of me

She stood so taken aback that she could not at first speak Her eyes
rested in astonishment on his face It seemed to her like the face of
Nin translated into what it might have been but just was not From it
her look flitted to the silent brother who had not moved from his post
and who stood with the queerest expression on his face He had taken
his pipe from his mouth was holding it in his hand and staring at it
You would have declared that he was afraid to look up afraid to meet
her questioning eye

Yes she said when she regained her breath of course I have heard
of you You are Mr Guyses twin brother II did not know you had
come

I didnt know myself that I was coming until last night he replied
gaily My chief gave me a few hours leave quite suddenly This is a
bad place to get at but fortunately we have got rid of all that
beastly snow that fell last week and my brother was able to drive over
and fetch me

And he can stay four or five days broke in Madam joyfully Her very
voice had changed Gone was the forbidding sullen woman who had so
lacerated the girls feelings that day There was a flush on the faded
cheeks the eyes had light in them She wore a handsome gown and a
diamond brooch Olwen wondered which was the real womanthis smiling
mother or the dull moping vacant creature to whom she had grown
accustomed

And so old Nin managed to let you down skating and gave you a bump on
the head I hear went on Wolf lightly He had thrown himself into the
chair next hers and was pulling Daffs ears with fine white
wellshaped hands which did not at all resemble those of his farmer
twin But it cant have been as had as my brother wants to make
outor at least I see no signs of it How clever ladies are with
their hair

His eyes his smile swept over her admiringly his voice said How
charming you are by its tone not by its words

Oh I am nearly well she answered vaguely for so many new ideas
stormed at her brain that she could not at first think clearly I want
to know how you are Mr Guyse she went on addressing Ninian
pointedly Ayah told me you had a shocking cold

Still without looking at her he laughed nervously Oh theres nothing
the matter with me he replied huskily

Oh but there is she answered quickly You are still very hoarse
and you look she went on wistfully you look pulled down

On that he gave her a queer glance quite momentary and turning away
began to clean out his pipe stooping for the purpose over the fire

As Wolf had evidently not been given the true account of the accidenta
circumstance for which she felt deeply grateful to Madam and Ninianshe
could not allude to it nor thank Ninian for his care of her The new
arrival had changed everything Her anger against Madam must be choked
down she must smile and be polite to this handsome young man must
behave as though all were well and everyone on good terms

Ive been quite eager to see you went on Wolf confidingly You
know we had the greatest bother to get Madam to consent to ask a lady
to come here and we were so afraid she would bite your head off when
you came But no Each letter she has written me has been full of news
of you She tells me you are settling down to be quite happy here

Everyone has been very kind replied Olwen gravely but I fear I
shall have to leave at least temporarily in a day or two The doctor
says I must lead quite an idle life for the present

Well cant you do that here laughingly he demanded Our ancestral
home seems to me an ideal spot for the purpose We must suborn the
doctor and get him to say so However at least we have you safe for a
few days as you cant travel without his permission and the poor chap
is confined to his room with a sharp touch of flu so we heard in
Caryngston today

Olwens little Oh of dismay was interrupted by the entrance of Sunia
with the tea That the doctor should have flu in such weather was a
most likely thing to happen yet to her after what she had gone through
that day Wolf Guyses unsuspicious words seemed like another twist of
the cord that bound her to the Pele

Keenly the eyes of the ayah swept the room keenly they dwelt upon the
faces of the four persons present She placed the little table where it
always stood and beside it the chair Olwen always used when she sat and
read aloud to the others Tea ready misseebibi said she softly

Olwen rose not without an effort went to her chair sat down and
dispensed tea Ninian who had only spoken that once since her
entrance watched her movements brought hot water as she needed it and
handed cups and cakes while Wolf engaged Miss Innes in conversation

By the time tea was over the girl was almost exhausted This was her
first venture from her room and her head still felt weak She leaned
back in her chair and her replies became languid

Ninian who had hitherto been most unusually silent suddenly woke up
and began to tell Wolf a long story of the picturesque drunkenness of a
certain farmer in the district and how his horses had brought him
safely home His brother listened with what seemed like astonishment at
his selection of a subject When they had done laughing the younger was
approaching Olwens chair Ninian stood up swiftly and going to the
billiardtable began to pull off the cover

Play you fifty up before dinner said he

Done was the reply and in a minute the two were busy lighting the
large lights over the billiardtable leaving the convalescent free to
rest

Instinctively Olwen glanced at Madam to see if she wanted anything but
Madam had no eyes no attention for anybody but Wilfrid She made him
move her chair so that she could watch them play asking eager questions
about what games Wolf had had lately how hard he was worked and so on

Olwen had slipped into the large low chair which usually was Ninians
property She lay there with her eyes closed trying to fix her
thoughts coherently She was vaguely terrified because she did not
understand There seemed no reason in Madams behaviour while that of
Ninian was so wholly unexpected as to be affrighting It was some weeks
now since they first dropped into the habit of teasing each other
chipping each other behaving like brother and sister And nowwhat
Was he ashamed of his mothers conduct Was he apprehensive lest her
coarseness might have scared the girl Or did he not wish his brother
to know on what terms they stood He had the air of being embarrassed
Well a man might well be embarrassed if he considered himself bound to
marry a girl because of such an adventure as they had been through
Was it true that Dr Balmayne was laid up It must be Wolf could not
be also in the plot whatever it was against her He had said that the
doctor had flu and had assumed that she could not leave the Pele
until he had sanctioned the removal She comforted herself with the
thought that there were several days to spare before the Stupendous
could reach Liverpool It would really be better for her not to start
upon her travels yet she felt far from strong If only Ninian were not
in this curious mood she would feel quite different

Come Miss Innes said Wolfs delightful voice you must back one of
us Heres my silly old mother putting her money on me Wont you back
Nin

Why yes certainly she replied sitting up so that she could see the
table Whats the game now

Wolf gave the score and informed her that if Nin won he would have to
give her a pair of gloves Is he the kind of chap you would back to
get anything he wants in the usual way he asked mischievously

Reflecting that Ninian might see a point in her answer which the
questioner could not intend she replied I think he is usually content
with very little

Wolfs laugh had perhaps an edge of malice By Jove youve hit it
said he chuckling and faint heart never won fair lady eh

Oh laughed Olwen in sudden malice longing to sting Nin into speech
the fair lady seemed willing enough the day I saw her

Hallo Whats this I am going to hear news cried Wolf approaching
her chair cue in hand

Ninian spoke from where he stood leaning over the table in the act of
making his stroke If you dont lie back in that chair and keep quiet
Miss Innes you shall go back upstairs to bed he said calmly

Mr Guyse I must ask you not to talk while you are playing cried she
when his cannon failed Kindly remember that I am backing you

Backbiting me I should say he replied gloomily chalking his cue

Well Im a generous foe If our talking scandal put you off your
stroke little brother we are dumb was Wolfs amused comment He
looked from one to the other as though highly entertained

Come thats better said Olwen lying back as admonished I assure
you Mr Wilfrid I often make him quite brilliant but if he loses this
game he knows what to expect in tones of mock anger

What am I to expect demanded Nin speaking from the far end of the
table

Well I shall never go skating with you again for one thing

I shouldnt suppose you would do that in any case he replied in
what almost amounted to a return to his old manner

You want me to ask why so I just wont she flashed back I am not
well and my repartee department is all out of order

You always end with a jades trick said Ninian as he once more took
his turn

If youve got to the point of searching Shakespeare for your repartee
I fear you cant win she told him sadly It was not long before her
foreboding was justified and Wolf had to announce that her champion was
defeated

Its my fault said she He has had nobody but me to play against
this winter and of course it has spoilt his play As she spoke the
dressingbell rang

Olwen asked Madam if she might be allowed to dine with them as she was
without changing Madam said she looked all right and Wolf improved
the occasion with a neat phrase but Ninian said calmly

Miss Innes will not come down to dinner She is already tired and
will go upstairs now

Oh Mr Guyse Is this my punishment for backbiting she pleaded
standing up and looking beseechingly at him Wolf happened to be the
other side of the room putting the cues into the rack so that the
reply was not audible to him

No its my own punishment for letting him beat me As he spoke his
eyes for the first time that evening met hers Without a word said
she understood that it cost him something to utter the sentence that
would send her awaythat consideration for her health had prompted his
ungracious speech She held her breath for a minute her face full of a
tender light He lowered his own gaze turned slowly from her strolled
down the room and opened the door Sunia was waiting outside with a
shawl Olwen bade good night to the others and passed out Ninian
held open the door and did not seem to notice her outstretched hand




 CHAPTER XXVII

 THE FINAL INSULT


Olwen came downstairs the following day between eleven and twelve
oclock

It had been raining heavily since early morning but was beginning to
clear and the temperature was much milder than it had been when first
she arrived in that country

From her window as she dressed she had noted that a soft purplishbrown
tint was beginning to overspread the woods on the further side of the
Guyseburn and knew that this was a token of the budding of the leafless
boughs Somehow the fact that spring was on its way was consoling and
made her feel more normal She was schooling herself to believe that
Madams talk had been as it often was unbalanced and that she ought
not to take too much notice of it Nothing could have been less
presuming than Ninians manner overnight He certainly had not worn the
air of one who knows that a girl is in his power

As she descended the stairs she was considering the question of her own
departure She could not decide whether it would be wise to say openly
that she was going to Liverpool to meet her father and obtain
permission to stay at the Pele until the boat was almost due so that
she could journey straight to Liverpool without returning to Bramforth

She felt that this was far the best plan if things could be so
arranged It would give her a longer convalescence and save money and
travelling If only the new and welcome addition to the party would
remain to keep the peace it might be done

She wished that Dr Balmayne had not chosen this inopportune moment to
fall ill His advice would be invaluable for explain it away as she
might something held her back from putting complete confidence in the
Guyse family She knew that there was something odd in her
positionthat they opened her letters and spied on her movements It
was this which made her unwilling to divulge to them the contents of
what she was fairly certain was the only letter which had reached her at
the Pele uncensored

She descended the stairs and when she reached the hall instead of
emerging into it and opening the door which led to the diningroom she
continued along the passage which as has been said was in the
thickness of the wall and gave access to the diningroom behind the
tapestry There was a door there but it was most often open as the
tapestry curtains were thick enough to keep out draught and the
narrowness of the passage made it easier to move along if the door were
laid back flat against the wall and secured by a staple

Thus once more and quite without intention she overheard something
that was not meant for her ear It was Ninian who was speaking and he
spoke like a man at bay

Well then I say straight out on those terms Im damned if I marry
the child

Wolfs voice replied almost immediately But you havent got any
alternative old man and if my mother is to be trusted no more has
Miss Innes

Without a moments pause without reflecting an instant with every
passion at white heat Olwen flung aside the curtain and came
tempestuously into the room

The brothers stood upon the hearth side by side almost the same
height almost the same build so alikeso unlike

Their faces as they confronted her were a curious study

I am not an eavesdropper said she fury steadying her voice You
should not discuss me with the door open if you do not wish to be
overheard There is no need for Mr Guyse to suffer damnation I have
not the slightest intention of marrying him as he well knows Now Mr
Wilfrid Guyse perhaps you will kindly explain what you mean by saying
that I have no alternative but to marry your brother

Wilfrid and Ninian both stood for quite an appreciable moment dumb
before this crisis Then Wilfrid laid down his pipe upon the stone
mantelpiece turned to her and said gently

I fear you have made some mistake Miss Innes What if I may ask did
you think that we said

I heard quite plainly what you said Mr Guyse said he would be damned
if he would marry me and you replied that you understood that neither
he nor I had any alternative I want to know what you meant by that

Ought you not he asked with a mischievous smile to attack my
brother first If he really said what you think you heard it seems
that it is he who ought to answer for such a preposterous

Not at all What he said was perfectly justifiable He said he wasnt
going to be pushed into marrying me Well that is just what I should
wish him to say I hope you know she went on with just a perceptible
break in her voice as she turned to Ninian that I am completely in
sympathy with you in this matter I have nothing to complain offrom
first to last you have acted just as you ought Madam has made some
dreadful kind of mistake but we both have such clear consciences that
we can afford to laugh at what people say Oh cant we Cant we

The last words were a sudden appeal made with clasped hands for as she
spoke Nins face upon which had appeared his usual demonlike smile at
first had slowly grown whiter and whiter He was looking at her now as
though she had hit him desperately hard

You can laugh of course at anything anybody may say and I can
knock them down for saying it he replied slowly his hoarseness making
his voice sound a little strange to her

But of course she went on too carried along by her subject to make
any very special note of the extent of his agitation of course your
brother is different People who circulate lies can be knocked down
but he ought to be told exactly what happened Mr Wilfrid Guyse will
you let me speak to you Will you let me tell you what has passed

I shall be more than honoured he replied his eyes fixed in evident
interest upon her He wheeled an armchair forward but she made a
gesture of dissent and remained standing confronting him

It wont take long theres not much to say but you must be made to
understand how we came to be out all night If after all that your
brother went through he were to be blamed  it would be dreadful He
has perhaps told you that I was stunned knocked on the head by a bit of
rock which fell upon me as we were descending Dukes Crag If I had
fallen I should have been killed but Mr Guyse was able to catch me
He not only upheld me but actually succeeded in bringing me step by
step back to the top and it was a wonderful thing to do for I was all
the time a dead weight By the time he had accomplished that feat and
we were in safety you may guess that he was tired but in spite of this
he carried me the best part of half a mile through the fast falling
snow to the only shelter there was for miles round When we were once
there there was nothing for it but to stay By that time it was dark
I was helplesshe had no brandy He could not carry me further the
nearest house was so far off that he might have been lost in the snow
before reaching it and it was so cold that in case of his not returning
I should have frozen to death Now do you understand Do you see that
he had then most certainlythough it is not true to say so nowhe had
then no alternative but to stay with me and take care of me until the
snow ceased to fall and we had some chance of finding our direction

Wolfs eyes rested upon the eager upturned face with sympathy and
something which seemed like admiration My brother has an eloquent
advocate he said a little mischievously I own I am glad to hear
your account of the affair

Mr Guyse and I had Madams full permission to go upon our skating
expedition she went on ardently Our being detained was sheer
accident and all my life I shall look back with gratitude upon that
night and the thought of what your brother did for mehis patience and
consideration were alike wonderful She broke off For a moment she
thought that she had done Neither of the two men eyeing her silently
almost breathlessly moved or spoke and suddenly she resumed One
thing more I have heardit has been hinted to methat Mr Guyse has
been accused ofof different conduct inthe sad affair which happened
here three years ago I want to say lifting her head proudly that
judging by his behaviour to me the other night it would take a great
deal to make me believe anything at all to his discredit in any other
case That is all

Silence fell upon the room as she uttered those words which seemed to
be driven out of her by some inner force She had not meant to say
this had not even known that she felt it Yet it came from her like
the cry of her inmost being For a few instants the succeeding pause
was full of possibilities It was broken by Ninian who turned walked
to the door and went deliberately out shutting it behind him with some
force In her zeal of championship Olwen hardly noted his going except
as it allowed her to speak more frankly to his brother

You cannot mean to tell me she went on more quietly that you
consider after what I have told you that I have compromised myself or
that any blame could be attributed to your brother

Wilfrid had turned rather suddenly to the fire and stood staring at the
flaming logs You are right of course he said in a low voice
Poor old Nin

There was a pause during which he took up his discarded pipe cleaned
and refilled it You know he continued presently when he had it
well alight I cant help being glad that you chanced to come in at
that moment The situation was puzzling me a bit and now I think I
have got the hang of it Dont let anything my mother may have said
worry you She is really extremely attached to you I have not heard
her speak so warmly of anyone for some time You and Ninian evidently
understand one another and I think this will all blow over very soon
It would be a pity would it not to let aa sort of misunderstanding
interfere with the fine work you are doing here

She answered You are very kind I cannot stay however I shall have
to leave in a few days time

I hope you will reconsider that decision After all we must call it
careless of my brother to allow you to be scrambling up a cliff face in
February when the rock is all rotten with the frosts The least we can
do is to see that you are cured before leaving us Wouldnt it be
rather heartless of you to shake off the dust of your feet against us

She laughed a little Oh she said with traces of embarrassment it
is not that II have to go home in any case I she hesitated
wondering how to express it without mentioning her father I shall be
changingI mean I intend to change my occupationI shall not be free to
take a post in future she concluded stumblingly not seeing at all
that to her listener this could have but one meaning He must suppose
her to be contemplating marriage His face fell

If that be so we must make the most of your last few days he
answered gracefully I got the postman to telegraph for a motor this
morning and I propose to take you and my mother out for an airing this
afternoon She has been shut up indoors for some weeks Ninian tells me
and it always makes her a bit capricious Make allowances for her Miss
Innes She has had some bad times

Oh I know I am so sorry to think how much I have added to her
vexations although most unintentionally

He drew up a chair close to hers after this and began to talk By
insensible degrees they slipped away from all sore subjects and found
themselves conversing on current topics and comparing their taste in
fiction and the drama Wolf was like a whiff of civilisation in the
savage solitude

Neither Madam nor Ninian appeared until dinnertime when the lady
entered but Sunia with a very reproachful glance at Olwen said the
sahib had gone to Lachanrigg and would not be back until teatime

They had a charming drive for it was the end of February the sun did
not set until halfpast five and the clouds had all rolled away
leaving the most brilliant sky that Olwen remembered to have seen since
her arrival The setting of the scarlet sun in purple mist was a thing
to remember

Owing to Wolfs thoughtfulness tea had been ordered downstairs to
spare Olwen any unnecessary exercise After tea Madam went to her own
sittingroom to lie down and after a while Wolf also sauntered off
leaving Olwen alone by the fire Ninian had not come in and her whole
mind was racked with speculation as to the why and wherefore of his
mysterious behaviour

Im damned if Ill marry the child

All the afternoon the words had rung in her head Could he really have
thought that she meant to catch him The mere idea made her writhe
Anyway she had spoken out at last He knew that she was not the Lily
Martin brand

I am glad she reflected I wonder if I realise how glad I am about
father Even if he is very trying even if he still runs into debt
even if people look down their noses at him still he is somebody to
belong to I shall not stand alone as I have stood with everyone
saying Poor child She must earn her own living for she has nobody
to do it for her Aunt Ethel wont speculate as to whether a really
eligible young man would overlook my having been a clerk in a bank
Fred Holroyd will no longer feel moved by compassion to protect me Dr
Balmayne will no longer debate within himself as to the degree to which
he may push remonstrance

She would have a place in the world It would be at her fathers side
She would also have a refuge from thought and memory both of which were
scourging her cruelly just now

She could not help remembering how happy she had been upon the fine
frosty morning when she and Ninian had driven together to the Crag
Lough Now everything was changed

The sound of Daffs barking outside made her prick up her ears The
outer door banged there was a scuffle of feet some words in a deep
voice and Ninian opened the door

She sent him a welcoming glance from her chimney corner You are
late said she reproachfully

He looked as if half inclined to bolt Daffie rushing against his legs
from behind settled the question for him He entered with a laugh and
a reckless swing closing the door

If Id remembered that teacher was about again I should have hurried
more said he in almost his usual style

Olwens heart leapt

For a punishment only three lumps of sugar in the first cup said she
rising and going to the table the teapot which had been keeping hot
before the fire in her hand

He took a seat not his usual place at right angles to her but at the
further end of the table pushing aside Wolfs cup and plate in order to
sit there so that she knew it to be intentional

Hows the broken head he asked in a brazen sort of tone

Mending fast

Thats right Easier healed than a broken heart isnt it

Well I dont think I ever tried

No and I dont think youre likely to he replied eyeing her as it
were by stealth I wonder what kind of lovemaking would melt you
down Not sending you silk coats by post Ill go bail

The hot colour flamed to her face She was at that moment wearing the
rosecoloured coat which Ben had sent

Ha cried Nin with glee Look at her cheeks Daff Some stray shots
go straight to the goal It was a man then

I dont understand You are speaking that unknown tongue which you
used when I first came

Yes One cant always be on the highbrow tack you know Ive
chucked it I express myself far more easily in my own language with
the onesided smile and green light in the eyes which still made her
think of Mephistopheles

She looked steadily at him for a moment and then said Very well It
would be a pity to bore you

Yes he replied helping himself to a piled spoonful of jam It is a
bore to tell lies and Ive told more since you came than ever in my
life before

Then the sooner I go the better she swiftly cried to which the
retort was instantaneous

Sure thing

She sprang to her feet snatched her shawl from the back of a chair and
put it on You wont mind pouring out your second cup said she

No thatll be right enough but before you go off in a naughty temper
there is a little ceremony we ought to go through isnt there

I dont think so

But I do and we may as well get it over He leaned his two elbows on
the table with his cup of tea supported in front of his lips in both
his hands Miss Innes will you marry me he asked and took a drink
immediately

She stood looking at him for a long minute without speech hardly
knowing whether to go on jesting or to let her anger have its way At
last

Ive a great mindoh I really have a great mind to say Yes and be
revenged Just to see what you would do You go too far You rely too
utterly upon my good manners What would you do now if I were to
say Yes

He got to his feet his eyes gleaming I should think if youre not
an idiot you know pretty well what I should do he replied and took a
step towards her

She winced as if her hurt had been physical In her passion of
selfdespising she could almost have shrieked This was the man she had
championed this the man who had so she told him that morning only
from first to last acted just as he ought

She got to the door somehow When she actually had the iron ring of it
in her hand she felt strength to speak I stood up for you she said
gaspingly II dont think I have deserved that you should treat
melike this

He turned an odd colour but she was too absorbed in her own outraged
feelings to remark that His voice was steady enough as he answered
Now you know what sort I am Like nothing on earth eh But you
havent answered Ive asked you to marry me and youve almost
accepted me you know

Accepted you  Accepted you

Come Thats more like Miserable caitiff avaunt Soil not the ear
of Vere de Vere with thy pernicious twaddle But I say if Ive
guessed right and you are turning me down in a manner which might
perhaps be described as unmitigated at least youll let Madam and my
brother know that I did come up to the scratch wont you As for
Balmayne Ill tell him myself that I asked you but you wouldnt have
me

She could not resist a last thrust Did you expect me to take your
damnation upon my hands

Youve come pretty near it Im more than halfway to hell at this
minuteput out your finger and Ill come the rest of the way

As he stood his green eyes flickering like light upon steel the idea
that he was the worse for drink flashed upon her for the first time
Had that been the explanation of his devilry upon the occasion of their
first meeting It was from the bar parlour of a tavern that he had
appeared upon her horizon Was thisthisperhaps the real meaning of
Dr Balmaynes hints

As she fled from the room upstairs to her chamber she had but one
intention in her mind

It was the intention to escape She must leave this house leave this
man with his unholy fascination put all this degradation behind her
and run to her fathers arms as to a city of refuge




 CHAPTER XXVIII

 ESCAPE


Sunia awaited herSunia with eyes that seemed to entreat to expectto
listen breathless for some tidings

For the first few minutes Olwen sat where she had flung herself in her
chair beside the hearth fighting for the control she knew to be so
necessary if she were to carry out the purpose taking shape within her

First she was inclined to announce that she would not go down to supper
On reflection she thought it would look better if she were to dress
quietly as though nothing had happened allow Sunia to leave her and
then be as it were suddenly obliged to undress and go to bed

She owned in a low voice that she was not feeling well and the ayah
in consequence tended her with extra gentleness and no words When she
had hastened away upon her other duties the girl began to consider
possibilities

It was of no use to ask to be driven to Caryngston because they would
say she was not well enough to travel She could not post a letter
ordering a fly to be sent until tomorrow which meant that she could
not set out until the day following It seemed clear that her only
practicable course would be to descend the mount walk through the woods
and go to Lachanrigg where Mrs Kay would no doubt have her driven to
Raefell station and her homeward journey would be more simple than by
way of Picton Bars

So she sat cogitating planning by the fireside until as she had
expected the ayah returned to know why she had not come down to supper
She said she had been suddenly taken faint and must lie down begging
that no food might be brought to her

Sunia had her disrobed and between the sheets in a very short time She
then departed returning as well the girl had expected with a tray of
appetising fare Upon the plate lay a note addressed merely to O I

Hoping that Madam had chosen this manner of giving her notice she
opened it Then her colour changed Whatever she had expected she had
not been prepared for what she read


I cant stand this I give in I must tell you everything Thats
what Ive been trying to avoid I made an attempt to write it down but
in black and white it makes me seem too great a blackguard How can I
see you alone Could you come down to the banquetinghall at six
oclock tomorrow morning It wont take long for I shant try to make
excuses You shall know me for what I am and then I suppose it will be
Goodbye for always

Nin


Half stupidly she sat up in bed staring at the tapestried walls
holding the paper in her shaking hand

Her trust had been misplaced Ninian had evidently lied to her when he
professed his innocence with regard to Lily Martin Just now in the
diningroom he said he had told more lies since her coming than in his
life before Yet on the summit of Dukes Crag he had sworn that he had
told her nothing but the truth She could not reconcile it The only
saving clause was that he had determined to confessat last

Tumultuous thoughts chased each other through her mind

Did he really care for her In her heart she believed that he did She
had trusted him and that trust which he knew to be undeserved had
melted him at last He would not marry her with this hateful thing
between them He meant to tell her  what

Strong shuddering seized her She felt her whole self yearning with
longing unutterable for himfor the merest chance to believe in him
She knew that if he showed her his sweet side she must believe anything
he told her Yet ah How could she pardon it if the girl who
attempted suicide wereit must be put in plain languageif she were as
Dr Balmayne evidently thought Ninian Guyses discarded mistress

She must not would not love such an one as he must be if this were the
atrocious truth

How her words of defence her assertion of faith in him must have cut
him to the heart He had left the room and the house precipitately He
had wandered about trying to make up his mind he had been suddenly
confronted with the sight of heraloneand had intended flight That
not being practicable he had turned to his usual weapon derisive
flippancy

Having hurt her more deeply than he intended he had at last come to a
decision to make a clean breast of it

Such was the situation as she saw it How to grapple with it was the
point upon which all her energies were directed

It came to her soon as with a flash of illumination that at no cost
must she allow Ninian to give her the explanation he desired Her
weakness where he was concerned was too abject She was in his hands
The one thing she craved was to be in his arms If he dropped his rude
flippancy if he pleaded she well knew there was in her no force to
resist him

In the extremity of her mental distress she loathed herself for her
weakness yet acknowledged the mans power

She wondered whether after all Madam was the best judge of her own
son and whether this knowledge was the cause of her anxiety to get him
married even to so poor a match as Olwen Innes She must know or
suspect the worst Her opinion of Ninian as the girl had seen from
the first was anything but highwas in fact what it must be granted
the truth of this ugly story

 And she little fool wanted him loved him longed for him with
every pulse she possessed So strong was the rush of her feeling that
she felt she dare not see him dare not meet him even in the presence
of others for a single moment more If she decided to renounce him it
must be done forthwith and her better self had so decided

How to accomplish her flight was now the question

As has been said the top floor of the Pele like the others was
divided into rooms Of these there were three the remaining quarter
entered from the stairs being a receptacle for spare articles a kind
of landing This landing formed the southeast quarter Olwens room
opening from it being the southwest Sunias room was the northwest
next Olwens and from the way she would emerge thence bearing trays of
tea and so on the girl had always suspected that on that side of the
tower there was another newel stair This reflection now gave her an
idea Knowing herself to be safe from observation for the moment she
sprang out of bed and went to reconnoitre It was as she had supposed
In the corner of the ayahs room was a little door set slanting and
within was a stair not quite like the one in general use for it was
enclosed in a circular corner turret and she knew it must go straight
down to the ground floor and no doubt communicated with the kitchen by
a passage in the thickness of the wall

By this stair she could go so she believed right out upon the narrow
walk which edged the tower upon its precipitous side The door below
was not likely to be locked from without The key would almost
certainly be in it If she waited until all were in bed she might thus
get away with ease The difficulty was that she could not enter Sunias
room when its owner was there without being heard

With the thought that there might be some small chamber in the wall
where she might lurk until the woman came up to bed she slipped down
the dark corkscrew descended past the next landing and reached the
first floor Here were two doors one leading into a passage and one
into the Priests Room

This was the place She must dress herself warmly creep down the
stairs leaving her own room locked behind her hide in the Priests
Room wait until the house was quiet and then simply let herself out

Hurriedly reascending she set about her preparations putting what
little money she had into a small handbag with one or two necessaries
In order completely to reassure Sunia she wrote a note to Ninian put
it in an envelope and sealed it elaborately It contained only these
words


I will come tomorrow morning if I canO I


When Sunia came to take away her supper tray Miss Innes gave her this
note impressing upon her the necessity of delivering it quite unseen by
anybody else The ayah undertook the commission with beaming smiles
Was not this intriguethe very air in which she flourished She would
in return have done anything that Olwen chose to command and when
ordered not to come in again but to leave the invalid undisturbed until
morning she cheerfully consented

It seemed to the overexcited girl a long time before everything was
arranged finally for the nighta supply of bedcandles near at hand
Brands extract and Horlick lozenges in case of hunger in the dark
hours the fire built up as only Sunia could build it a kettle full of
hot water in case her bottle needed replenishment

Was not any girl a fool to leave such luxury Was she going to flee
when Ninians love awaited her Just because he had behaved badly to
another girl who if her portrait were to be trusted was distinctly a
minx

Yet words would ring in her head words learned when a child in the
schoolroomHaste for thy life escape nor look behind

As soon as she felt sure that Sunia had gone down to her own supper she
arose and dressed herself with the greatest haste all but her thick
boots These she carried in her hand wearing her felt bedroom slippers
that she might make no noise upon the stone steps

Warmly wrapped she crept out into Sunias room locking her door behind
her and taking away the key Very softly she descended two floors
opened the little door and emerged into the Priests Room

In the pitch darkness a very narrow thread of light was visible below
the door which opened into the banquetinghall She sat down hardly
daring at first to breathe upon an old armchair which she and Ninian
had stored away there when rearranging the room She began to wonder
how she would know when the ayah came up to bed for it was quite
possible that she might not come up this way at all since she could
reach her own quarters through the third room upon the top landing a
room intended for another servant should the dwellers in the Pele employ
one

There was a youngish moon near its setting Olwen gazed from the window
and noted a curious fact The light from the Pele windows was flung
right across the valley and made little squares of radiance upon the
black trees on which it fell There was the pattern of the oriel quite
big and bright There too was the diningroom below it extinguished
even as she gazed Presently about half an hour after the beginning of
her vigil the little glimmer at the very top That was Sunia Yes
there was another patch which was Madams window To watch them become
dark was amusing

But although these darkened most satisfactorily the oriel in the
banquetinghall remained lit up This was awkward Somebody was still
awake still sitting up in the Pele If she began to move about would
not she be heard Could she leave the Priests Room close the door
behind her descend the stairs unlock the door below and shut it again
without some unwonted stir penetrating to the ear of the watcher

If it was Ninian as she thought most likely Daff would be with him
and she dare not risk attracting Daffs attention

Her eyes fixed upon the farflung square of light saw a shadow flit
slowly from side to side It must be Ninian and he was pacing
restlessly to and fro The longing to push open the door of her
hidingplace and emergeto run to him and forget everything in the
stronghold of his arms was hard to master She closed her eyes that
she might not see the weary pacing

There was nothing for it but to wait until he went upstairs She was
very sleepy the armchair was comfortable the night not very cold
She slipped into slumber

When she awoke it was with a start She was cramped and chilly and at
first wondered where she was and what had happened It was not
altogether reassuring when she recollected that she was in the Priests
Room She gazed from the window The light was extinguished in the
oriel and everywhere else The moon had also set which made it a very
dark night for her expedition She had hidden a box of matches in her
bag and she ventured to strike one To her horror she found that it
was a quarter to four However it could not be helped Having got so
far she meant to carry out her plan and she hastened downstairs laced
her boots and before long found herself out in the cold dark hour
before the dawn Instantly she made the disagreeable discovery that it
had again begun to rain She had no umbrella but was warmly clad and
as soon as she was under the trees she was sheltered It was wet and
not at all easy going but she held on knowing that the descent was not
really very long and that as soon as she was in the larger path to
which it led down she would make much easier progress

She would hardly have credited the difficulty of threading ones way
along a path among trees in the pitch dark If once she left the track
she felt that she would never regain it When at last she stood upon
the wet dark leaves which thickly carpeted the main path along which
she must turn to her right she felt that the worst was over

The rain was to be regretted for she was not yet quite well However
she comforted herself by reflecting that Dr Balmayne had said she might
go home on Thursday and this was almost Thursday She struggled along
pretty boldly for some time listening to the rush of the unseen river
below her on her left hand It had been fast bound in frost when first
she came Now its song was loud and clear and when at last she reached
the lower level of the meadows she found that her path was under water

This was quite unlooked for She dare not risk stepping through water
of unknown depth in the dark so she struck up the hillside to her
right After going up some distance she found a track which seemed to
go in the right direction and this she followed until she was extremely
tired In her remembrance of the way the woods ended after about two
miles and you crossed open meadows to the farm She felt sure she had
walked considerably more than two miles and the woods were still thick
about her In one way this was good for it kept her dry But she
began to think that she had better not go on too far without knowing
where she was She had little choice however To sit down and rest in
the wet wild woods was a risk she dare not take Usually untiring on
her feet she felt the power to go on for a long while yet

Another halfhours walking on ground which still ascended brought her
to a gate leading out of the woods upon a high road Here she felt sure
that she must turn to the left since she had not crossed the river and
Lachanrigg lay upon its bank But when still farther on she came once
more to crossroads she had no idea whether she ought to go on or to
turn again She had now been at least two hours upon her feet and the
first dim light of dawn was beginning to make the line of the roads more
apparent the hedgerows blacker

As she stood bewildered wondering what to do she heard a sound of
cheery whistling along the road she was deciding to follow Could this
be a human being someone who would direct her She felt a rush of
hope and stood waiting until out of the gloom ahead came the figure of
a sturdy boy wearing the cap of a telegraph messenger

His whistling probably executed in order to keep up his own spirits
upon his lonely tramp was suddenly checked and his feet halted In her
mistcoloured coat and veil the apparition in the road might easily have
been something of the kind which raises the hair

To reassure him she called out at once Oh please can you tell me how
far am I from Raefell Station

The boy stopped After the manner of his kind he said nothing of his
startled surprise though his chest rose and fell rapidly

Its all of five miles he replied stolidly Want to get there

Yes but I did not mean to walk all the way How far am I from
Lachanrigg Farm

Lachanrigg Oo thaats a canny way baack Six mile happen

Oh she cried Am I really nearer the railway than I am to
Lachanrigg

It appeared that this was so

I came through the Guyseburn woods she said and the path was
flooded so I went up the hill and lost my way

Dye coom from t Pele asked the boy with sudden interest

Yes she replied not desiring to risk a lie which might be quite
unnecessary

He gave her a long speculative look his hand fumbling doubtfully with
the leather pouch containing the dispatch he carried An inquiry after
her name was trembling on his tongue but to deliver a cablegram to an
unknown woman in the dark was too risky It would save him some miles
of unpleasant walking but on the other hand it might cost him his
job It did not occur to Olwen that he was bound for the place she had
come from for she believed she had come far out of the way Her
preoccupation was to obtain directions for reaching the station and
these he gave her It did not sound a difficult route and it would be
dawn before long With hearty thanks she bade him good morning and set
off Beyond a headache she did not feel overtired She thought she
could manage five miles and she had several malted milk lozenges with
her She took her way and the boy took his bearing the message which
contained such important news for herself




 CHAPTER XXIX

 BRAMFORTH AGAIN


Some time later Olwen sat down by the roadside upon a very wet tree
trunk and wondered if she could get any farther

Things might have been worse for the rain had ceased at dawn and the
weather was not so very cold But her head ached excruciatingly and
she was conscious at the moment of hardly any desire except to find
herself back in her room in the Pele with Sunia in attendance

A winters morning and an empty stomach taken together do not make for
heroism She was wondering vaguely why she had acted thuswhat had
induced her to pass the night in such an illregulated fashion and what
she should say to the Vicarage circle at Bramforth when she got there

The sound of an approaching motor upon the road gave her a faint hope of
a lift It caused her no apprehension for she was not aware that the
car which Wolf had chartered had been hired for the time of his stay and
was stabled at the Pele According to her calculation there was not
yet time for any pursuit to catch up with her even if they knew which
way she had gone Thus as the car swung round the corner she had no
foreboding and she stood up by the roadside her arm outstretched to
attract the attention of the occupants But for this they might have
passed her without notice for they were travelling fast and daylight
was not fully come

There was an exclamation a sudden jamming on of brakes they drew to a
standstill and she found herself caught Both the Guyse twins had come
in search of her Ninian was driving Wilfrid beside him

In a moment the whole frame of Olwens mind changed The weakness of her
spirit passed She was almost free and they had pursued

They did not mean her to escape

In her terror and distress a cry broke from her She held up her
hands like one at bay and her voice was strangled as it is in
nightmare as she gasped

Go away Go away I will not come with you

Wolf was at her side He held his cap in his hand and his expression
was that of pitying kindness

Thank God we have found you he said What can have happened Did
you walk out of the house in your sleep

She put up her hands to her throat as if she were choking No no I
have escaped she panted I will not go back I tell you I will not
go back

Oh but I think you must was the gentle regretful answer You
could not be so unkind as to cast this slur upon our hospitality We
know that there have been difficulties but I do most earnestly assure
you that my mother has always wanted to do her very best to make you
happy and comfortable Surelysurely things were not so bad yesterday
that nothing would do but a midnight flight Come come He took her
helpless hands Try to quiet yourself Try to reflect You are
feverish and overwroughtnot fit to travel Let me

He was drawing her gently towards the car where it waited Ninian had
kept his seat at the drivingwheel his face hard set looking straight
in front of him as though he had turned into a chauffeur

In her extremity resisting the compulsion of Wilfrids hands the
unspoken reproof of his eyes she appealed passionately to the elder
twin Ninian she cried help me Dont let me be taken back I
wont go back I cant  You know I cant

Ninian flung himself into the road and approached

Why Wolf was saying half playfully if Ninian knows why you cannot
stay with us another hour he knows more than I do Come come when
the doctor has been and your temperature goes down you will be grateful
to us for having saved you from the consequences of a little temporary
deliriumindeed you will

Ninian spoke suddenly She isnt going back if she doesnt want to
he announced

But my dear chap what can she do cried Wolf

What do you want to do asked Ninian standing over her

She lifted her white face to his Her knees were shaking under her she
was within an ace of sheer breakdown but his unimpassioned coldness
steadied her a little I want to gohometo Bramforth she brought
out Oh please please

Miss Innes anybody would tell you that you are not fit for a long cold
journey began Wolf but Ninian pushed him aside

You really mean it he demanded of her You are determined not to go
back to the Pele You insist on leaving us

His voice sounded lifeless and weary

Yes yes she faltered bringing out her handkerchief and wiping the
two drops which had overflowed her eyelids and lay on her white cheeks
I must go Cant you see I must

He stared along the dim road as though he stared into the future

This is the end then

She assented dumbly

All right Ill take you to Raefell and see you into the train
Theres a through carriage on the 820 and you can get to Newcastle
without changing He turned to open the door of the car adding as
she hesitated You cant trust me even to do this

She yielded at that touch She was wax in his hands If he had caught
her up in his arms told her not to be silly but to come back with him
she would have done it Perhaps Wolf saw and it may have been the
reason why his fine lip curled as he looked at his brother rather
contemptuously

Miss Innes got into the car obediently Ninian opened a bag which stood
on the seat and produced a thermos and a package of sandwiches He
poured out hot coffee and made her drink it Then wrapping the fur
carriage rug warmly about her he shut her in took his place with Wolf
beside him and they made best pace for Raefell

She hardly knew what were her thoughts as they sped cm Probably she
did not wholly trust Ninian and was watchful to see whether he really
would do as he promised When they arrived in the pretty village set
among woods sloping to the river they stopped before the inn and Wolf
dismounted as it seemed to her unwillingly

I will leave my brother to see you into the train he said coming to
the window Goodbye I am regretting every minute that your visit
should have such a termination It was doing my mother no end of good
Dont you think even now

Nin started the motor and he was obliged to stand back

They crossed the river and doubled back to the station on the further
side There was not much time to spare Ninian opened the door and
helped her out with her handbag leaving her a minute in the
waitingroom while he went to get her ticket The train drew in to the
station as he returned He put her into a firstclass carriage and
covered her knees with the fur rug from the car She began to object
both to the class and to the loan of the rug

You can send it back by post he replied tucking it about her
There is your ticket You have an hour at Newcastle plenty of time
for a good lunch You are due at Bramforth at a quarter to three
Goodbye

Goodbye The rush of feeling was overpowering This was the end and
by her own act her own wish All the fervent life the keen emotion of
the last few weeks was over and there was nothing to be saidnothing
She joined her hands as if to hold herself back from stretching them
out to him For a moment her teardimmed eyes caught a green ray from
his I leave you as I came cried she with a gulp a little blue
thing with a red nose

He nodded speechless and to her mortification shut the door upon her
and departed there and then though it was a long minute after before
the train began to move She gazed from the closed window upon the
waiting car but could not see its driver He had not remained for so
much as a parting glance

With all her heart she then wished that she had consented to let him do
as he asked and make a clean breast of it

For some miles her mind held but one idea There was a place on the
line where upon looking from the window of the train one could see
Guysewyke Pele square against the skyline Upon catching this last
glimpse she set her whole attention In vain The mist was too thick
No distances were visible She began to cry then miserably and
persistently It was over She was going back It was an ignominious
return Had she felt less ill it is possible that she might when she
reached Newcastle have taken a train for Liverpool instead of
Bramforth She dare not however risk such a proceeding today

With her own hand she had pushed away a temptation whose strength
appalled her She had done her duty but the thought brought no drop of
consolation She felt as if her very heart had been torn out of her and
as though the gaping wound so left would never heal

At Newcastle she was much too depressed to go to the restaurant and she
crept into the ladies waitingroom where she nursed her grief in a
corner Presently a boy came in carrying a teabasket Lady in here
ordered a teabasket he piped All the dismal occupants of the place
shook their heads He advanced doubtfully

Well thats funny Ive been all over the station It was a lady
with a grey coat and veil he went on placing himself before Olwen

I did not order it but I shall be very glad to take it she replied
It was a fortunate blunder for her as the hot tea was just what she
needed her thoughts winced away from the idea of dinner This seemed
an extra nice tea with buttered toast and brown bread and butter

As she emerged from the waiting room a polite porter just outside
relieved her of her bag and rug putting her into a comfortable
compartment with a label Ladies only on the window

Her night of wandering had tired her so much that being able to lie
down she presently dropped asleep and forgot her misery for a time

As she neared her journeys end she reflected with vexation that she
might have sent a telegram from Newcastle to tell the Vicarage to expect
her Even an obvious precaution such as this had not once occurred to a
mind entirely preoccupied with its own distress

However when the train at last drew in to the dirty noisy clamorous
platform she had hardly opened the door of her compartment before she
descried Aunt Mauds yellow mackintosh

She almost fell into her aunts hungry arms Oh she cried how did
you happen to be here

Why I came to meet you of course You telegraphed this morning

Ohdid theythat was kind said the girl falteringly II thought I
had better come home I was ill They didnt want me to travel and I
expect they were right for IIve left all my luggage behind

Her aunt was looking at her with much concern and some consternation
She suggested an immediate visit to the lost property office but Olwen
said that she had seen to thather things would be sent on

Im afraid we must drive she faltered I feel too crocky to walk I
can afford it for they paid my railway fare

They found a taxi and got in Miss Wilson full of anxiety to hear fuller
details of the circumstances and her niece realising and wondering why
she had not sooner done so that it was wholly out of the question for
her to reveal what had actually happened

The doctor was taken ill she explained slowly and he said it would
be a long business and I was at the top of the tower having to be
waited upon I did not like to feel that I was being a trouble

As she spoke they were passing having been held up by the stream of
traffic out into the main road from the station approach Her eyes
fixed vaguely upon the passing show suddenly dilated A tall man
coming from the station had just gained the island in the centre of the
thoroughfare and was detained by the passage of a huge motor lorry from
moving on immediately He had his back to her but had she not known
the figure the clothes were familiar to her It was Ninian Guyse

An instant and the fastrunning taxi had carried them away

This sumptuous fur rug Aunt Maud was saying It will cost something
to send back

She did not notice the sudden pallor the stifled silence of her niece
or if she did ascribed it to exhaustion Olwens emotions were
turbulent Ninian must have come in her train all the way It was to
him doubtless that she owed the persistence of the boy with the
superteabasket also the courtesy of the porter During those hours
of anguish when she had been imagining them parted for ever he had
actually been within a few yards of herperhaps in the next compartment

The force of the shock of joy was enough to show her her own heart She
could hardly say a word for some minutes

Miss Wilson gathered the impression that Olwen was more ill than she was
willing to admit She thought the best thing to do was to put her to
bed at once and leave her unquestioned until she had had a long rest
On receipt of the telegram her room had been prepared by her aunts own
hands before she set out for the station Olwen was very grateful

Aunt Ada no less than Aunt Maud was quite evidently glad to see her on
any terms although she detected behind their affection a jealous hope
that their darling had not been a failurethat she was not in any sense
of the word coming home in disgrace

She could hardly give as emphatic a denial to the suspicion as she could
have wished for she dreaded very much what Madam might say should she
take it into her head to write to her grandfather

She remembered the threat held over her and knew that her flight would
cause deep displeasure It seemed almost certain that Mrs Guyse would
indulge her anger to the extent of a severe letter

 But Ninian was in Bramforth 

Nothing could take from the joy of that For what had he come

The answer which her heart returned was that he had come to make to her
under the shelter of her home roof the confession which he had not been
able to make at the Pele

Her bedroom was very cold and her bed very hard She thought of Sunia
with a yearning which made her wonder whether she had been induced by
the ayah to swallow some nostrum unawares which should produce acute
craving for the Pele the moment she left it

She fought however with such thoughts She must pull herself
together rest be ready for the morrow He would know her to be too
tired today for him to venture upon a call

She passed however a disturbed night awakening with bad dreams every
time she went to sleep They most kindly insisted upon bringing some
breakfast upstairs to her After she had eaten it she slipped out of
bed and started to rummage among her things to find a clean blouse
which she might put on

Before she was dressed she heard the familiar click of the gate latch
and from behind her muslin blind saw Ninian stalking up the gravel path

The doorbell pealed and with a small giggle of delight she hugged the
thought of keeping my lord waiting chafing cooling his heels in the
ugly cold drawingroom

He was shown in of that she was certain But no message came up to
her After waiting a while during which she completed her toilettenot
without an illtempered struggle over the arrangement of her hair to
conceal the scarshe crept out upon the landing The cook was sweeping
the hall and a cautious signal brought her halfway upstairs

Cook is there a gentleman here

Yes miss said the woman who was a new arrival since Olwens
departure

Did you let him in

Yes miss

For whom did he ask

For the vicar miss

For the vicar

Yes miss He asked how you was and I said you wasnt downstairs yet
Then he asked for the vicar and theyre talking together now in the
study

Olwen crept back shaking with anxiety What was Ninian doing Why did
he want to see her grandfather Was he assuring him that she had left
without their desire Was he giving that full account of their
nocturnal adventure on the Fell of which Madam had warned her He was
taking time enough over it anyway

Restlessly she wandered about up and down her room every moment
expecting a summons and every moment growing more excited more
apprehensive The hands of the old tin alarum clock upon her
mantelpiece moved on yet still the visitor was closeted with Mr
Wilson

At last she heard a noisethe sound of an opening door Softly she
crept to the balustrade and saw the top of Nins black head as he came
out into the hall Her grandfather accompanied him to the entrance
There they shook hands In a moment as it seemed to her the door had
opened and closed upon him He was gone He had left the house without
seeing her withoutor so she must supposeeven asking to see her

Almost at once she told herself that he would return He had been asked
to lunch doubtlessor he was coming back after dinner So far had
pride sunk that she wished she had been out in the hall to waylay
himjust to look into his face and judge what he was feeling

Her grandfather stood in the empty hall his hands clasped behind his
back as if plunged in deepest thought At last he lifted his head

Cook Is Miss Innes dressed

Yes sir I believe she is

Kindly tell her that I wish to speak with her at once upon matters of
grave importance




 CHAPTER XXX

 THE INCREDIBLE TRUTH


It did not take long for Olwen to reach the study Her whole self was
nothing but one huge mark of interrogation as she went into her
grandfathers presence Her eagerness was even enhanced by her
desperate dread She felt that she might be going to receive the
wigging of her life What tales had Ninian told of her or himself

The old man was not seated but pacing his room in evidently great
perturbation As he turned to face her she saw that his usually
parchmentcoloured face was quite red He eyed her with a peculiar
stare which struck terror to her heart

But he cant do anything to me she said to herself I have got
father nowsomebody to stand up for me

My dear how are you was the vicars pacific opening I was sorry to
be out when you arrived yesterday but when I came in your aunt said
she thought you had better not be disturbed

I dont feel very well yet thank you Grandfather but I am well
enough to hear what you have to say

He eyed her apprehensively II wonder said he shuffling across the
room once more Then turning he sat down at his desk as though
resolved upon controlling his nerves He cleared his throat Be
seated my dear he said quite solicitously His faded eyes dwelt upon
her as she obeyed his behest I haveerjust had a visitor

Yes Mr Guyse I saw him come she replied as naturally as she
could

Yes Hm You and he have seen a good deal of each other

We have It was winter and the Pele is not at all a large house

How did he strike you I wonder But perhaps such a question is merely
futile We must come to the main pointthe surprising I may say the
extraordinary information which this young man has just given me My
dear you must prepare yourself forfor something in the nature of a
shock

Oh Grandfather please please tell me Is it abouabout Mr Guyse

Well in partin part it is Very painful very distressing of course
 but in the main it concerns you my dear you and your father my
poor soninlaw Madoc Innes

She sat like a stone My father she whispered Hehe is worse Ah
dont say he isdead

The vicar bowed his head His hands were playing with a cablegram which
lay upon the table before him

He is dead he said This message arrived for you after you had left
the Pele yesterday morning Mr Guyse brought it to me because he
feared in the state of your health he ought not to give it to you
under the circumstances He thought you should be safe at home when the
news was broken Eryour aunt forwarded you a letter from New York
which she thought was from your father some days ago

She found her voice with a sob Yes He said he was comingsailing in
the Stupendous I was to go to Liverpool to meet him That was
partly why I hurried home Oh dont say he is dead dont say I shall
never see him

My dear you must calm yourself sufficiently to allow me to proceed
The most surprising part of the story is still to be told I have
seldom been so completely taken aback as by the news Mr Guyse has just
given me

Mr Guyse What does he know about father

Ah my dear that is the point Thatisthe point He did not know
poor Madoc himself but it seems that his twin brother knew him very
well indeed

Wolf cried the girl bewildered Wolf knew my father

Intimately They were in Alaska together They went to Klondyke
together Your father had the most astonishing good fortune He struck
an oil well when he was looking for gold It was in the very place
where it was most wanted He managed to keep it quiet until he had
bought up all the land he required and then turned it into a company
He diedyour father dieda millionaire my dear

He handed over the cablegram and she took it in her hands


Regret Madoc Innes died yesterday Wire at once permanent address to
Ware and Shuckton solicitors 536 West Fortyninth Street New York
City


Olwen faced the old man with a blank stare She had thus far drawn no
inference at all

Theerthe Guyse family is I gather greatly impoverished went on
the vicar presently She assented still bewildered

Yes The brother in London was in regular correspondence with your
father and knew he was desperately ill In fact he knew that he could
not live long While he was staying at the Pele for a few days
vacation at Christmas they saw quite by chance your advertisement in
the daily paper The name of Innes struck the young man for he knew
well of your existence having heard your father speak of you He knew
that poor Madoc had not been in communication with you for yearsthat he
had willed all his fortune to you that he meant to claim you when he
returned to England but that his state of health made it unlikely that
he would ever reach this country Your first letter in which you
signed your name in full made him certain that he was right The name
of Olwen was so uncommon He suggested to his brother that they should
offer you a post in the family that the elder Mr Guyse
shouldersecure your affections and that you should become engaged
under the impression that nothing was known of your fortune

The girl to whom he spoke uttered a choked cry She rose from her seat
made for the window as if to open it stopped halfway dropping on her
knees before a big chair on which her head fell while she shook with
helpless sobbing

So thisthis was the truth the incredible undreamedof truth

She had been picturing one kind of infamy for Ninian when all the time
it was something different but just as contemptible He was nothing
more exalted than a fortunehuntera mean hypocritical fortunehunter

There had been a deliberate plot to which of course both Madam and
the ayah had been parties To get her there to pet her and make much
of her and later when she proved harder to manage than they had
anticipated and time was running short to entrap her to persuade her
that she had no choice but to make the marriage which had all along been
planned

Oh she thought I shall go mad This is more than I can endure

Her grandfather in much distress vainly begged her to be calm

I must ring for one of your aunts he said at last and this threat
enabled her to control herself

No no dont do that she gasped swallowing her tears I am going
to be sensible I will try and face it You see it is so dreadful so
wild so madand it is all coming at once

It is most natural that you should feel emotion dear child I myself
hardly know what to say or to think replied the old man wiping away a
tear Such a change of fortune is enough to stagger the strongest
head

Clever plan of theirs wasnt it she muttered with an irony whose
effect was marred by tears Seems quite a pity they just did not bring
it off Oh Ninian Ninian why did you confess Why must you roll
yourself in the mire like this

It was as you may imagine with great difficulty that the young man
brought himself to speak to me on such a subject He did so because he
said you had refused to hear him and he wished me to inform you of the
facts He seems to have had scruples from the first But there were
heavy pecuniary liabilities concerning which he was not very explicit
However I gather that as the days passed his natural good feeling began
to get the upper hand You were so unsuspecting you were being cajoled
and hoodwinked In short he came by degrees to feel that he could
not bear it and that the dishonourable plot ought to be made known to
you

It was probably more policy than honour that suggested that course
she sneered If my father came over he knew he would be found out

Well there is that view of the subject said the vicar doubtfully
They did know of course that it must come out sooner or later Had
you been actually married I suppose there would have been no help for
it I think he added with hesitation yes I do really think that
the young man was heartily ashamed of himself

I trust he was said Olwen with trembling lips Think Grandfather
suppose he had succeeded I am young and inexperienced Suppose he had
made me care desperatelywhat then

He looked at her with solicitude

That of course would have been most regrettable However alls well
that ends well and he will never trouble you again

Standing in the window her face turned from him she repeated the words
blankly He will never trouble me again  I suppose not Oh how I
wish that he had been caught in his own net If I had been a different
girl tall and beautiful and fascinating If I could have made him wild
for me and thenthen found out this so that I could punish him make
him suffer as I am suffering now

This outburst was beyond the scope of the old cleric who sat peering
with weak eyes upon a passion that passed him by

Isis Mr Guyse still in Bramforth she asked at length

No I understand that he made his visit to me so early because he had
to catch a train He has gone back to Guysewyke

Over It was indeed over In all her thoughts of Ninian she had not
suspected him of playing the hypocrite with her Now she saw it all in
the fierce light of her grandfathers bald words He had played a part
with herpretended he liked her pretended he was eager for her
society As time went on he must have seen that what was all jest
to him was earnest to her He had begun to feel some stirring of
remorse I wish to God I had never seen you  Im damned if I marry
the child

How easy of interpretation now were those words which had been so
puzzling

How nearly she had fallen a prey

It seemed as if Providence had intervened to save her as if some power
greater than herself had nerved her to that midnight flight and spared
her the humiliation of hearing from the lips of the man she loved the
cruel fact that he had meant to marry her for her money

He had gone back to Guysewyke

And Wilfrid handsome debonair Wilfrid had been privy to all this
He who knew her father well had kept silence on that head Together
he and Ninian had planned to net a fortune How very nearly they had
succeeded

She summoned up a picture of Wolf standing in the damp treeshaded
road coaxing her so gently back to the car luring her so plausibly to
return to her prison

He had not succeeded Ah God be praised for that She was here at
Bramforth bruised half killed but safe Oddly enough she had at the
moment a glimpse into the soul of Madamthe other heiress who had been
lured into a loveless marriage by a former Ninian Guyse She pictured
herself dull faded embittered listless while the man who did not
love her passed lightly on his way

From that she was savedat least she was saved from that

He was as deep in debt as I in love he only wanted my fortune He
said I expected too much  She seemed to hear the very tones of the
dry lifeless voice

I think said the vicars quavering voice that you should try to
turn your thoughts a little from this young man to the startling news he
brought It seemsthough it is hard indeed to realisethat you are
not only wealthy my child but enormously wealthy Ithe broke off
with a nervous little laugh Such a thing has not happened before in
our family I will confess that it has shaken me

Olwen came out from her own trouble and faced as it were suddenly her
fortune from a new standpoint She saw it no longer as the devilish
thing which had tempted Nin to pretend that he loved her but as a
weapon of power something that should enable her to repay to the family
who had mothered her for so long some part of their unselfish
performance of duty

Oh Grandfather she cried springing to her feet She ran to him
flung her arms about him and broke down into laughing and tears To
be able to make you comfortable to give you all you want  and the
aunts Those wonderful aunts They shall come out into the sunshine
the people who have patronised them shall come begging favours Oh
Grandfather it is true you are sure it is true We are not making any
terrible mistake

I feel sure that it is true Mr Guyse brought me this paper to read

He laid before her an American newspaper containing a long paragraph
upon The Glen Olwen OilKing Madoc Innes


Madoc returns a millionaire to the old country Left home without a
fiver Left something that cost him more His only daughter Miss Olwen
Innes Romance of the goldseeker Miss Olwen knows nothing of the
pile that awaits her

So it ran


It appears that Mr Guyses brother wrote recently to your father
telling him that you were staying with his mother at the Pelespeaking
as though your coming there had been accidental That accounts so Mr
Guyse thinks for the fact that the New York lawyers sent the cable to
the Pele direct

Oh they planned it well didnt they But somehow I escaped the
snare said the girl a little wildly She sprang to her feet ran to
the door opened it and cried aloud for her aunts They came in their
faces expressing consternation in every line

Olwen you ought to be in bed you look half crazy child let me take
your temperature

The heiress flew upon undemonstrative Aunt Ada locking her vigorous
young arms about her Take anything you like she cried for I owe
you everything I have or am Oh Aunt Maud Aunt Maud Do you remember
how we played at fancying we were rich chose our house in Gainsley
Park furnished it with our favourite things out of the best shops
chose our Daimler or our RollsRoyce and went off together for a tour
in Italy Well well do it Well do it all Well do more than ever
our poor little starved imaginations dared to think of You shall do
just exactly as you like my dears from this moment for the rest of
your lives

Is she crazy In a high fever cried Aunt Maud apprehensively
lifting the burnished locks to gaze anxiously upon the wound beneath

The vicar got to his feet He trembled as his gnarled hands rested
upon the sheet of soiled blottingpaper on his desk

Its true my dears she is not crazy Madoc Innes is dead and has
left her more money than she will know what to do with




 CHAPTER XXXI

 THE CHANGED WORLD


Olwen Innes stood in the hall of her house in Chelsea bidding goodbye
to her guests It was a charming hall for the wall of a room had been
removed to make space for it and the result was excellent creating an
effect quite unlike a London house

Though years had elapsed since she acquired No 2 Orchard Row this was
her housewarming and the guests who were departing were all of them
friends in more than name since they had become acquainted under stress
of the most terrible period of modern history

Hardly had Olwen decided where she would make her home hardly had the
decorators completed their dainty work upon it when the European War
broke out No furniture was as yet in the house and Olwen and Aunt
Maud promptly turned it into a hospital for wounded officers

The expenses of its working were borne entirely by the mistress of the
house and Aunt Maud personally superintended all the catering During
the grim summers and winters when the fortunes of the Allies ebbed and
flowed the new heiress worked as hard as ever she had done in the
Palatine Bank with short and very occasional holidays

Now that peace had returned and the warworn nation was settling down
once more the hospital emptied gradually the nurses departed and the
owner found herself at last able to indulge her taste for beauty and to
remodel the place which for so many months had been a refuge for some of
the bravest of all the splendid men who served their country

Languidly and like a patient who has undergone a severe operation
England opened her eyes upon Peace once more It seemed incredible and
for long its unreal aspect was increased by the fact that the officers
and men of the vast new armies returned only tardily and in small
numbers from their regiments

Crippled limbs crippled incomes crippled businesses were the order of
the day everywhere a brave attempt to hide financial wounds to triumph
over personal sorrow to set the face steadfastly to the England of the
future wherein so much was changed so much was gone never to be
replaced so much one felt was in store but not as yet near fruition

A good many of the officer patients who had passed through what came to
be known as the Orchard Row Hospital had been anxious to persuade Miss
Innes to join them in founding at least one family for the future of
England But in vain Aunt Maud said the war had changed Olwen It
had sobered her Or was it perhaps her illness

A somewhat severe breakdown followed her foolhardy midnight flight from
the Pele For a long time she was too ill even to write to Mrs Guyse
to thank her for her kindness during her stay As soon as she was well
enough to travel Aunt Maud took her abroad They had returned to
England in the June before war was declared Since that time so much
water had rushed under the bridges of life that one could hardly keep
pace with the swift flow of events Everything personal sank into the
background and was lost The war and the war only had been the
preoccupation of existence ever since Olwen became rich Except in the
one direction of helping those she loved she had not tasted the sweets
of wealth One of her first acts was to make her grandfather resign his
living He now resided as had always been his ambition in a pretty
and comfortable house at Harrogate in company with Aunt Ada and was
happier than ever in his life

His departure from Bramforth made intercourse with the Holroyds less
easy Grace became a VAD worker as soon as war broke out and she
longed to come to London and help Olwen with her hospital But there
was too much to be done in Bramforth and her mother disliked the idea
of her going so far Thus the girls had seen nothing of each other
until Gracie came to town for her first taste of pleasure since the
VAD work became a thing of the past

She now stood beside the young hostess and watched the leavetaking with
interest

What a lot of people you know she remarked when the final guest had
departed and they turned and went up the wide staircase to the
drawingroom

A good many said Olwen though when I took this house I knew nobody
in London These are almost all the families of our various patients or
clergy with whom we have been brought in touchdoctors visitors or
helpers of some kind I feel rather like the upstart ladies who cut
their steps to the abode of the upper ten by dint of big subscriptions
to charity or the secret party funds Really I havent tried to
advertise myself but the people with whom I have found myself thrown
are mostly nice and I dont believe they realise how rich I am They
passed into the drawingroom and she sank down upon a low chair with a
little lazy yawn and stretch We are getting deluged with
invitations said she Youll have to come with us to two or three
houses tomorrow afternoon What time does your brothers train
arrive

Somewhere about halfpast four at Kings Cross

The small motor had better meet him said the mistress thoughtfully
He wont have very bulky luggage

Ben Holroyd had not been to the war Government had taken over his
mills and he was indispensable to their management Olwen had given
but little thought to him during the stress of the past years Now she
was idly reflecting that he was the only man she knew of whose
disinterestedness she could ever henceforth be sure as long as she
lived He had loved her honestly and with no thought of money He was
to arrive on the morrow to spend a couple of nights and take his sister
home Olwen and he had not met since the outbreak of war

The change wrought in both girls by the passage of those years packed
with destiny was noticeably great Gracie who had been threatened
even at the time when Olwen went to Guysewyke with a repetition of her
mothers unwieldy embonpoint was now almost slender fined down to a
muscular trimness the result of unremitting work She was happily
betrothed to a north country Temporary Captain who in peace time was
a solicitor and was now busily employed gathering up the threads of his
interrupted practice in preparation for marriage

Olwen bore more plainly still the traces of what she had gone through
Her face had acquired as it were new meanings Her beauty which had
always been largely a matter of expression was now much more evident
than formerly Those who met her for the first time never failed to be
struck by her to remember her voice her lookWhat a memorable face
Miss Innes has said old Lady Cumberdale when she came to visit her
nephew one of those officers who had implored Olwen to marry him I
never remember to have seen an English girl with quite so much
distinction but she looks sad

The remark was repeated to Olwen She sighed remembering who had once
described her as a dainty rogue in porcelain Not much of the rogue
was now left Everyone always added that little conclusion to any
criticism of her appearance She looks sad

The sadness had been there throughout the weary months of war but as
long as the necessity of the moment kept her at work it had been an
undercurrent far below the surface Like the hopelessly estranged
husband in A Confession she might have said

 Therefore I kept my memory down by stress
 Of work


But memory howsoever held down arose the moment the grip slackened
and stood upon her feet Each day that passed seemed now to bring the
heiress back a step across the dim gulf of separation to the reliving
of the old days at the Pele

Since the moment when overlooking the balusters at Bramforth she had
seen the top of Ninians sleek black head a little bent as he moved to
the door no word of him had ever reached her He might have stepped
from the vicarage threshold clean over the rim of the world for all she
ever knew to the contrary

Her own severe illness had almost immediately supervened Everyone
thought it natural enough not only that she should return posthaste
from Guysewyke on receiving the news of her fortune and her fathers
death but also that she should succumb to the double shock There was
no need for her to say anything to anybody in explanation of her
proceedings The Holroyds knew that she had hurt her head when skating
and had thought it best to come home in consequence but no suspicion of
the true state of affairs ever leaked out Old Mr Wilson kept his
granddaughters counsel faithfully The plot revealed by Ninian
remained in his own memory alone

By the time she was well again enough of the business resulting from
her fathers death had been completed for her to be in possession of
ample funds and she only craved to utilise this unlookedfor aid to
transport her out of the old groove to enable her to go where she might
find the means to turn her thoughts from contemplation of her tortured
aching heart

For a while the two powerful agents wealth and change of scene were
more successful than she had dared to hope In the crowding of new
impressions she let the thought of her humiliation sleep

Steadily she set herself to face the world as it was to consider the
position fairly

Ninian had indeed trampled her maiden pride in the dust He owned that
he had meant to marry her for her money He gave as the reason why he
had not fulfilled this intention his own consciousness that he was
playing a base part This was this must be only a courteous way of
saying that it seemed to him a shame to marry this girl a nice little
thing enough for her moneythat is without caring about her

In other words her attraction had proved insufficient to hold him to
his purpose

In the light shed by this atrocious thought she went over endlessly all
that had passed between them from the time of their first meeting She
remembered the disappointment which had been plainly observable in
Ninian when he met her first in the inn his subsequent changes of mood
Sometimes he had seemed as though he really liked her Then he had
veered as though he felt he could never keep it up His unreal
jeering manner was quite accounted for From the first he had felt
unable to be natural with her Then as time went on he had realised
that as a chum as a little sister he could have liked her well enough
and it had seemed cruel to cheat her any longer She saw it all with
horrible clearness and the worst pang was occasioned by the knowledge
that he must have seen and known that she was taking his sham attentions
for the real thingin short that he had been quite aware that the girl
he could not bring himself to marry was in love with him all the time

As she recalled scenes that had passed between them she felt able to
trace each alternation of his feeling between determination to take
advantage of her folly and carry out his purpose and the fits of
selfcontempt and shame which had from time to time overswept him

Sunia too Olwen had even been led by her vanity to think that the
Hindu woman really liked her Nothing of the kind The ayah was merely
helping to catch the golden goose for the use of her sahib and his
family

These were racking thoughts Her only consolation was the remembrance
that after all she had had strength to tear herself away Sometimes
she wondered whether her dead father had known of her danger and had
exerted some unseen influence to snatch her from the brink of the gulf
which threatened her and which she herself had so dimly perceived

When war broke out she at first failed to realise that all the young
manhood of England would volunteer She did not begin to study the
Gazette until three months or thereabouts after the beginning of the
campaign and not once had her perseverance been rewarded by the
discovery of any mention of the Guyse brothers Not that her search had
been exhaustive There had been days let slip under stress of a new
flood of cases coming into hospital She knew she had hoped that some
day the unlikely might happen and that one of those maimed heroes so
carefully carried on their stretchers into the quiet rooms and tenderly
laid upon the soft beds might turn out to be one of the Pele twins

Nothing of the kind had happened As the war went on patients were
more and more methodically distributed north to north and south to
south Chelsea received none of the casualties among men born north of
the Humber

One result there had however been from the ayahs boasted
incantations The call of the north was for ever sounding in Olwens
ears

Whether or no the woman had ever succeeded in administering the love
philtre Olwen felt fairly certain that she had found means to give her
some unhallowed drug for not poppy nor mandragora nor the far more
potent influences of money and the power that money gives had availed
to still the craving she felt to return to Guyseburndale

No day had passed since fighting began during which she had not prayed
for Ninians safety Now that all was over the stress and strain a
thing of the past she began to feel more and more certain that he was
dead

She knew enough of him to be certain that he would be reckless His
love for the Pele and for the land on which the feet of his forefathers
had trod for centuries was the main motive of his life For this he had
been ready to sacrifice himself and her until his own nobler nature had
risen and forbidden the banns Deprived of this last chance of
reinstating himself in the country what would he do

There was but one course open to him before the war broke out and that
was to marry Rose Kendall He might have done this but if he had not
then at the outbreak of war she felt he would have flung himself into
the breach Most likely he had been killed upon the Marne She could
fancy him going into battle with a jest upon his lips

 No Guyse
 Is ever wise
 Until he dies


It seemed certain that he was dead and that Wolf was master of the Pele
If it were so then she felt sure that he had sold the place and that
his mother had come to live in London to be near him

Was that really so Could it be so The image of the Pele and of all
that was in it was clearly before her minds eye and the picture had
all the qualities of permanence She felt that it literally could not
change

Then she tried to imagine Rose Kendall as its mistress That seemed
equally impossible

The craving to know the truth was growing to such dimensions within her
that she began to revolve wild plans for leaving town and going to stay
somewhere in the neighbourhoodso that she might obtain news without
seeming to ask for it

Are you frightfully tired Ollie asked Grace wistfully having spoken
twice without receiving an answer

Miss Innes came out of her reverie with a start Pardon old girl I
was just thinking said she laughing as she sat more upright and
gazed about her with eyes still introspective

I was saying that those people who went almost lastI think you said it
was Lady Cumberdaleseemed very nice I liked the girl

Lilla Penrith Yes she is a dear replied Olwen I told you we
nursed the brother here Captain Penrith He made a very good recovery
much to the surprise of the doctors since he developed enteric in
addition to his wound We are going there tomorrow afternoon If you
had not gone and got engaged so precipitately to James Heslop I would
have introduced you to the Captain he isnt half bad

The Honourable Miss Penrith took my fancy very much We had a long
talk She was doing VAD work too

She did it very well But we leave out the Honourable you know my
dear except upon envelopes

Do you Is she just plain Miss Penrith

Only that Did you suppose she wore her Honourable like a coronet
teased Olwen She talked at random for she was tired and her thoughts
had been switched completely away from her housewarming by the
unaccountable rush of memory which was assailing her

Aunt Maud came in smiling Well I do think it went nicely said she
Of course it ought because everything came from the best places and
our staff is efficient But this new idea of simplicity in
entertaining and not having any programme made me afraid it might be
dull However it wasnt

Before the war I should have paid a hundred guineas to a few
secondrate singers to perform good music to an audience that couldnt
understand it and only longed to talk said the mistress of the house
By the way Lady Cumberdale said quite apologetically that she is
having a programme tomorrow afternoon as she wants people to hear some
very fine singing from some poor girl whose career was interrupted by
the war

Im glad said Gracie with true Yorkshire fervour for music I can
never hear too much

Aunt Maud launched into the usual kind of talk for such an occasiona
repetition of what people had said and how they had looked much
comment having passed with reference to the different appearance of the
house since it ceased to be a hospital

Both girls were yawning before she had half done and she broke off
with a laugh to order them both to bed

Miss Maud Wilson looked ten years younger than she had done in her
nieces earliest memory She had regained much of the fair beauty which
had been hers in girlhood and Olwen privately confided to Gracie that
night during hairbrushing that it was Aunt Maud really and not she
herself who required a chaperon

Next day Orchard Row had recovered its normal appearance and the two
girls having breakfasted in bed just by way of contrast to the
strenuous fashion of the past few years passed a lazy morning lunched
in luxury and then dressed and started for Lady Cumberdales afternoon
party They looked in at another house en route but at about five the
car set them down in Chester Square and they heard as they mounted the
stairs the strains of the singing of the protgs as Olwen called
them

They entered as softly as they could and greeted their hostess
silently The men who were on the watch to see Miss Innes could not
approach until the song was done There were some minutes during which
Olwen stood still near the door glancing round for friendly faces

Someone who had been standing in talk with a girl moved so that the
face of the girl over whom he had been bending was suddenly visible to
Olwen It was a face which oddly succeeded in being pretty in spite of
a somewhat hatchetlike outline and green eyes Those eyes were subtly
expressive the curve of the lip showed a row of good teeth slightly
pointed The whole face reminded her of Ninian and her heart gave a
great throb

Lilla whispered she to Miss Penrith who was beside her as soon as
the music ceased who is the girl with the white plume in her hat
there against the curtain

That Oh thats Elma Guyse Lord Caryngstons daughter you know
Her only brother was killed at Neuve Chapelle

Her brother What the one who married

Who was to have married Washwhite SlickSoap Yes but it didnt quite
come off He went to the Front and never came back Shall I introduce
Elma to you

Oh presentlywhen you get a suitable chance

No more was possible for others were pressing forward to greet Miss
Innes and she had to talk about things of no interest while all her
thoughts were centred upon Elma Guyse She began half unconsciously
to move nearer by degrees to where the girl stood and was absurdly
disappointed to see her leave the room with a man in search of ices

Miss Innes said a voice at her elbow here is someone who wants to
be presented He says he has a slight acquaintance with youColonel
Guyse




 CHAPTER XXXII

 ONE TWIN RETURNS


For a moment Olwens very heart flagged in its beat She was so taken by
surprise that until she had had a moment in which to recover she could
not look up It had then been premonitorythe fashion in which her
thoughts had persistently strayed in the direction of Guysedyke during
the preceding twentyfour hours

Colonel Guyse Promotion had of course been rapid during the war
but that he should have risen to the command of a battalion

She kept her head turned away as long as she dared pretending to be
occupied in giving greeting to an elderly club man Mr Berkeley who
had been very good to her hospital in the way of presents of game fish
and poultry from his country estate Then with a feeling as though she
stood her back against the wall facing the rifles of a firing party
she turned slowly round

 And found herself looking into the deep blue eyes of Wolf He was
older more bronzed but his appearance was if anything more
attractive than ever The whimsical smile which he shared with his twin
was curving the mouth under his golden moustache

 But of course She had foreseen this She had known that it must
be so Wolf would be a colonel and Ninian would bedead

Well Miss Innes this is pleasant said Wolf genially I wonder if
you remember as vividly as I do the circumstances under which we
partedon the Raefell Road in the early morning

Why Olwen I had no idea you were acquainted with my cousin said
Lady Cumberdale pleasantly my maternal greatgrandfather married a
Guyse

Im afraid I didnt know it smiled Olwen as she shook hands with
Wolf but you ought to be aware by this time that Debrett had little or
no share in my education dear lady

It is the greatest relief to me to see Miss Innes safe and well went
on Wolf addressing her ladyship She came to stay with us at the Pele
the winter before the war and poor old Nin took her out skating and
allowed her to fall and cut her head open The blow made her delirious
and in the absence of her attendant she got out of the Pele at night and
went wandering over the country We had to race after her with a motor
and found her wet and half starved by the roadside

Olwen listened to this account of her proceedings with interest So
this was how things appeared to Wilfrid Well it was natural enough
She laughed a little but did not reply

My dear said Lady Cumberdale in much surprise what an adventure
Did it not make you very ill

Of course it did Wolf answered for her I knew she ought to be
bundled back and popped between the blankets in double quick time But
poor old Nin thought she ought to be humoured and it was her humour to
travel back to Yorkshire so he let her do so in her wet things She
had a bad time afterwards so I heard and it did not surprise me

Yes I had a bad time replied the girl with lowered eyes I lost my
father just then and it was a shock However I recovered completely

Greatly to the advantage of the nation said Wolf courteously if
what I hear be trueyou have been turning your house into a hospital
have you not

I have But I am glad to see that you apparently have been in no
need of hospital treatment said she brightly You look very well

Yes the army has got me for keeps as they say I used to be a
Territorial captain before the war you know so I was not quite as new
to my job as most of our poor chaps were But wont you let me take you
to have something to eat or at least a cup of tea

She went with him out of the room and down the stairs to the tea buffet
A particularly interesting item on the programme was just about to
begin so this room was comparatively empty They found chairs and sat
down together

Well he said after a prolonged scrutiny from beneath his thick
lashes So the country mouse has become a town mouse

But remains a mouse as you see Mice cant turn intowell into
gazelles for example or swans or birds of paradise

Now what I wonder is the exact significance of that remark pondered
Wolf aloud She smiled

Oh there was a time when the mouse longed exceedingly to turn into
something more striking she answered lightly but that was long ago
Now tell me some news please How is your mother

Im sorry to say that she is anything but well replied Wolf his face
clouding In fact Im afraid she is very ill Of course the loss of
poor old Nin was a great blow to her

Olwen felt the blood drain from her cheeks and saw that Wolf was noting
her ghastly whiteness Indeed she managed to falter II had not
heard I am so sorry  The lifeless words fell from her mouth
while her heart seethed within her I wish I had said I would marry
him she was fiercely thinking I wish I had let him kiss me as he
would have done that last evening It would be something to look back
uponsomething snatched out of the dreary wreck of everything Aloud
she went on Poor Madam must be very lonely

She is You know she never liked the Pele

Is Sunia still with her

Yes oh yes Sunia is there

She longed to ask for detailsto inquire when how and where but found
to her vexation that she could not do so with a steady voice

While she was struggling for composure Wolf began to speak He told
her how deeply disappointing it had been to him to be unable to continue
the acquaintance begun at the Pele before the war What he said was
quite light and not too pointed but he managed to convey the idea that
he had been interested in her from the first and had wished to see more
of her

She listened and replied as in a dream All the time she was wondering
how much Wolf knew That he had been in the plot to secure her fortune
was certain from what Ninian had told her grandfather But did he
knowhad he ever knownthat Ninian had confessed

From his tranquil selfassurance she felt almost sure that although he
must know that his brother travelled to Bramforth that day he yet had
no idea of his having given away the secret cause of her invitation to
the Pele

As she thought it over she felt it most likely that Ninian had said
nothing about it at home Wolf probably thought his twins intention
had been merely to see that she reached home safely and to give the
cable to her grandfather

So often and so closely had she pondered over the whole question as to
render it remarkable that at this precise moment a certain thought
dawned on her mind for the first time

She perceived clearly that Ninians confession had been quite
gratuitousthat if it had never been made nobody would ever have known
of the discreditable little plot

Had Madoc Innes still been living the damaging fact of Wolfs
acquaintance with him and knowledge of his affairs must have come out
But Madoc Innes was dead and at the time of making his confession
Ninian Guyse leaving read the cable knew that he was dead

Thus the secret was safe yet he had chosen to make a clean breastwhy

She could see no answer except that he was a man whose integrity
demanded such a course whose conscience would not be satisfied without
it

Examined in the light thrown by this thought his conduct showed up
gallantly Ah suppose she had all along been wrongsuppose that he had
loved her after all and that he had felt unable to take his happiness
without first frankly admitting the sorry part he had set out to play

That longing for his physical presence which had beset her when she was
at the Pele which had tortured her many times since now surged over
her until she could have wept with the pain of it

She no longer judged him she just wanted him with a craving now to be
for ever unsatisfied

The presence of Wolf was half agony half joy He spoke in a voice
which recalled another The expression of his face the very turn of
his head was so like that of his twin that she could not achieve any
sort of composure The news she had just heard the sound and sight of a
Guyse agitated her so deeply that she hardly knew what she did or said
She only knew that they talked for more than an hour and that when she
left Chester Square he had promised to dine with her at Orchard Bow the
following day

Going home in the car she had to brace her shaken nerves to the
knowledge that Ben Holroyd had arrived and would be awaiting them The
minutes between Belgravia and Chelsea had never seemed so few She was
on the rack

Ninwho had seemed the incarnation of health and nerve and sinewwhose
indomitable soul had resisted the depressing influence of poverty of
his sick mother of his joyless existence at the PeleNins lifeblood
was among that poured out that England might live At the moment she
felt that his twin brother was the only man in the world whose society
she could endure

By tomorrow she would have recaptured her serenity and be able to ask
the questions that trembled on her tongue but which her voice refused
to carry She would learn when where how that buoyant spirit had
been resigned those muscles of tempered steel had became dust

They arrived at Orchard Bow to find that the guest was in his room
changing for dinner Olwen was able to go to hers where her maid
awaited her a clever but unresponsive person who was not likely to
notice signs of mental perturbation As she skilfully but coldly
performed her duties the heiress thought as almost every day morning
and night she thought of Sunias soft hands and cooing voice

Oh for the days beyond recall Oh for the sound of a teasing laugh
the provocative gleam of dancing eyes the challenge of Nins utterly
masculine personality

She had had it all and lost it

Had she yielded had she loved him he would have gone to the war and
laid down his life just the same Yes but he would have been
hershers as in spite of reason in spite of scruples and fears she
had known him to be ever since the night when he had kept life in her
out upon the wild snowy fells

She wanted to be alone to cast herself down upon the floor and give
herself up to her desolation Nothing of the kind was however
possible She went downstairs at last and entering the drawingroom
found Ben in awed contemplation of the last note in modern interiors

He was very pale as he advanced to meet his hostess She thought he had
improved as almost everybody was improvedsince the war She knew he
had made a considerable sum of money and that the Holroyd Mills would
be henceforth quite on a par with those of her uncle Mr Whitefield
whose particular branch of industry had not been much in requisition
during the struggle Ben like Gracie had fined down yet he struck a
discordant note when set in the midst of the subtly restrained costly
elements which composed the general effect of the room

Oh Ben said Miss Innes sweetly I am glad to see you But I have
grown so oldso very old Should you have recognised me

He laughed uncomfortably Youre not speaking seriously Miss Innes
he replied rather ceremoniously I would recognise you anywhereand
however changed But you are not changed except for the better

She turned to Aunt Maud and Gracie Isnt that beautiful she asked
Could it have been better said Well and so here we are at last and
the black barrier which was stretched over the whole future of the world
is broken and gone We are free once more to think and talk of
ourselves a little

It was on her tongue to tell him that she had met Wilfrid Guyse only
that afternoon but when she approached the subject such a lump swelled
in her throat that she could not proceed To speak of any of the family
naturally was beyond her strength and she was sure that should anybody
bring in the name of Ninian she must break down obviously Therefore
she said no word though she knew that Wolf was coming to dinner the
following night and that she must collect her forces by that time must
even be prepared to hear his brothers death discussed as if it were
just the death of an ordinary person

The preoccupation caused by these considerations was so great that she
forgot to be awkward or tonguetied before Ben with whom she had
exchanged but a very few words since the occasion when she refused his
offer of marriage The evening passed off quite agreeably in an attempt
on the part of the three ladies to teach their visitor auction bridge
Aunt Maud through constant playing with convalescent officers had
become a really good player and Bens intelligence was of the calibre
which quickly seizes the drift of anything which can be accomplished by
the aid of common sense At the end of it all Olwen felt that things
had gone better than she had anticipated She had got through without
selfbetrayal and found herself at last alone in a world which no
longer contained Ninian and then her misery rolled over her head
indeed

Morning found her sleepless redeyed wretched Gracie exclaimed when
she appeared asking hurriedly if she were ill Ben whose own sleep
had been of a very broken and scanty description wondered if he dared
to hope that the bad night to which she was fain to confess had been in
any way connected with the thought of himself

The day was filled in with lunch at one of the big restaurants a
matine and tea at a fashionable lounge This programme inevitably
recalled to her mind as well as to Bens the occasion of the
expedition to Leeds Little had he then thought to see the girl typist
seated in her fine car entertaining him with a careless generosity that
had no need to count cost His love had indeed been disinterested

As Miss Innes dressed for dinner that night even the detached Parkinson
remarked that she looked very white

A few friends had been invited to dine at Orchard Row She had achieved
with creditable composure the imparting to Aunt Maud of the news that
Colonel Guyse was to be one of the number Aunt Maud who had always
had her suspicions was very careful not to betray them

As for poor Ben when the magnificent Colonel walked in he felt that
his own chances were gone for ever Nobody had made any explanation he
concluded that this was the Guyse in whose society Olwen had spent those
weeks at the Pele That these two would marry seemed the predestined
end

Wolfs manners were really extremely nice He devoted himself to
handsome Aunt Maud with a deference and desire to please which most
triumphantly accomplished their object At dinner he sat upon Olwens
right hand Ben being upon her left She explained to both gentlemen
her own pleasure in the fact that as she and Aunt Maud were of the same
sex and each took one end of the table the difficulty which exists in
houses where this is not so when the number dining is eight or twelve
did not exist

After dinner there was music and one of the guests sang charmingly
There was no chance at all for Wolf to have any private talk with his
hostess

The following day the Holroyds departed and Olwen reaped one benefit
from the meeting between Wolf and Ben namely that Ben went away
without attempting to resume a more intimate footing without the plea
which she had more than half expected and for which she was not yet
ready

The dread of her life was lest she should marry a fortunehunter and
Ben was the only man in the world of whom such a thing could never be
said Now that Ninian was no longer in question she dimly thought that
it mightsome daybe Ben

A day or two after his departure she was at home by herself listless
and dissatisfied Aunt Maud had thrown herself heart and soul into the
question of training partially disabled soldiers for various trades In
this question a certain General Grey was much interested and Olwen
thought that the half of his interest not monopolised by the soldiers
was most evidently given to Aunt Maud At the dinner aforesaid he had
sat next to Miss Wilson his absorption having suggested to her niece
that before long she would be left without a chaperon She was above
all things desirous to see her aunt happyto feel that life might at
last offer her something in return for those long years of rigid
selfsacrifice at the vicarage

It began to seem that Olwens only happiness in the future would be
gained in this wayby playing providence to those she loved

She was ready to feel her wealth as dust and ashes to wish that it were
gone and she under the necessity of earning her bread once more Night
and day she thought of Ninian until the craving to find out what his
exact fate had been became so strong that she hesitated between the
desire to question his brother and the determination to apply to the War
Office or some official place where complete lists had been compiled

Her inward suffering was so intense that it seemed to her that she could
hardly look anybody in the face without discoverythat her despair must
be written so plainly that none who saw it could fail to say she has
lost her lover

She had had tea and was sitting in a corner of the Chesterfield doing
absolutely nothing her capable hands listless before her her eyes
fixed on vacancy her thoughts gnawing incessantly at the one subject
which occupied themwhen Colonel Guyse was announced




 CHAPTER XXXIII

 THE BULLDROP


She went to meet him with the feeling that nownow was her chance He
must not go until she had inquired as to the exact facts which he
seemed to suppose that she knew already

He came to invite herself and Miss Wilson to go down to the docks the
following day to inspect one of the great captured enemy ships which was
lying there for the inspection of visitors She accepted the
invitation and they drifted into talk which grew by degrees more and
more absorbing He told her some of his more poignant experiences at
the front and she gave him a sympathy which he appeared to find most
gratifying Though he never said a word that could be called
lovemaking she yet felt increasingly that he was wooing her and the
fact that he was doing so with Nins voice and Nins smile and every
now and then with Nins very expression filled her with sensations that
she could not analyse She was half fascinated half revolted and she
had a feeling that if it went onif she should be much in his
societyshe would succumb to the curious attraction

A dozen times she tried to lead round the talk so that she could touch
upon the one subject without too great effort

In vain As soon as she found herself within measurable distance of the
words your brother her throat began to swell her heart quickened its
beat He had risen to take leave before she was aware He had gone
and her chance was over for the present

He called the following day and they motored down to the docks after
which he gave them lunch at the great new Anzac restaurant

It was as he was putting them into the car afterwards and stood
laughing and animated on the kerbstone making his farewells that her
eyes straying past his in order not to meet their challenge fell upon
a lady whose face seemed familiar to her The lady in question was
young and handsome in a showy way and as she strolled slowly past Olwen
thought her eyes rested upon their party with a look of special
interest The impression was momentary the stranger had moved on and
was lost in the crowd surging thickly on the pavement

As they drove home her mind held the picture of the backward glance and
the expression but subconsciously and all mixed up with Wolfs charm
and the magnetism of his personality

She felt that the hours she and he had passed together that day had made
a great a real difference

If matters were to advance at this rate she must face the situation
which might ensue She reached home in restless mood wondering how to
pick up once more the thread of a life which seemed to have broken off
short The war and its resulting activities had filled in at first the
blank which lay void after her departure from Guysewyke Now even that
palliative was taken away It showed itself as the mere stopgap that it
had always been In truth though peace had returned life was exciting
enough had she felt that politics and social economy were things that
could absorb her She did not so feel Hers was like her fathers a
nature which craved love as its startingpoint The fabric of her life
must be built on love so she felt or go to pieces

The Colonel had taken care not to part without an arrangement for
another meeting before long He was to lunch the following day at
Orchard Row and take the two ladies to see over one of the great new
institutions prepared for the reception of those permanently disabled in
the war

He came accordingly and the time passed charmingly Aunt Maud thought
him the most fascinating man she had ever seen The situation piqued
her curiosity Not a word of confidence had Olwen given her not a
sentence had she ever let fall concerning this mans twin brother with
whom she had spent so many hours at the Pele Miss Wilsons conviction
that some reason other than what appeared had all along existed for the
girls sudden departure from her post gained strength every minute

As for Olwen she felt that she was skating on very thin ice Easily
though Wolf talked he avoided any mention of his home or his family
He seemed to assume that Olwen knew of his brothers fate and he did
not allude to it Their talk was always superficial gliding lightly
over a surface beneath which were unknown depths

That day Wolf asked permission to bring his cousin Lady Caryngston to
call upon Miss Wilson and Miss Innes The plan was carried out very
soon afterwards and with her ladyship came that Elma Guyse who so
strongly resembled her cousin Ninian that it was agony to Olwen to be in
the same room with her

Every minute some tone in her voice some curve of her mouth some gleam
in her mischievous eye recalled Nin in his most captivating mood
Olwens emotion increased every moment She felt that she could no
longer endure the strain of going on in her present ignorance She
would ask Wolf all about Ninian even though in the attempt she found
herself compelled to betray her own feeling

Her chance came for the Colonel did not depart when the other visitors
left Aunt Maud had a committee at halfpast five and so made her
escape from the drawingroom going out of it with the two ladies Wolf
and Olwen found themselves left together and this was obviously the
moment for which she had waited so long He went to the window
glancing out to see if it rained Now or never

She moistened her dry lips and was just opening them to pronounce the
fatal words when the Colonel swung round saying carelessly

By the way I heard from my brother this morning

Silence fell She hardly breathed for a few moments Something within
her rose up in tumult and she had to beat it down For the second
time upon the mention of Nin she showed Wolf an ashen face

Your  brother she said at last feeling that at all costs she must
not betray the extent of her stupefaction

Yes I think you said you knew what a horrible fate befell him

Weakly she shook her head she could not speak

He seemed surprised But I thought the day we first met you said you
knew

No I dont know anything I beseech you to tell me

Well but at least you knew he was a prisoner of war

Noteventhat

Yes he got taken poor chap the very first time he went into
actionright at the beginning before we turned them on the Marne He
was badly hit and they picked him up and took him to Griesslauen the
most remote of all the military campsa place where unheardof things
went on We didnt know for nearly a year whether he was alive or
dead He was reported missing you know Rough luck wasnt it

Yees Rough luck Is he at home now

Oh yes hes been back more than six months now and his native air
has done a good bit for him but hes very much changed

Is hemaimed do you meanor disfigured

Oh no not as bad as that He had a horrible suppurating wound in his
leg the result of neglect and semistarvation but the Guysewyke air
healed that in a couple of months Of course things are very
depressing for him in fact hes just had another bad blow poor chap
and Im afraid hes taking it frightfully hard

Tell me  if you think you might I  want to hear

He came and sat down opposite fixing his eyes upon her quivering face
She was so rapt that she had ceased to heed what he might be thinking
Ninian was not dead He was not dead He lived She heard but
could not realise she felt as though a blow had stunned her

I dont know whether I ought to tell you said Wolf thoughtfully
Nin might give me socks if he knew But you seem to take some interest
in the poor old chap after all

She made a sound which she meant for a laugh but which was merely a
sob Perhaps I do

I dont suppose he ever conversed with you on the subject of finance
went on Wolf softly but you may perhaps have gathered during your stay
with us that he was pretty hard up

He was narrowly watching her face but she replied frankly enough

Of course I knew it I knew he was fighting as hard as he could so as
not tonot to have to sell the Pele

Oh you knew that You knew how set he was upon the old place

Indeed yes I knew

Well when the war came there was no way out of it He was bound to
raise such a sum of money as should make my mother independent in case
of his death He went to our cousin Caryngston and offered to sell to
him upon conditions

Conditions

Yes Caryngston was to give an undertaking not to sell again and to
allow my mother to remain in possession for the duration of the war

Thenthen it is actually sold

Yes At that time Caryngston was fearfully keen for his son was just
engaged to Miss Leverett daughter of an American millionaire

Washwhite SlickSoap she murmured

Just so Her father found the purchase money because he fancied his
daughter in a feudal pile and the deal went through Since that time
however the whole situation has changed Poor Noel went to the front
three months later and was to be married as soon as he got his first
leave Well he never got any leave He was shot before he had been
out a month Miss Leverett never became Mrs Guyse and the old man
wants his money back Caryngston cant repay him unless he sells the
Pele and he has written to Nin to say that he will be reluctantly
compelled to do so

Oh what a shame What an utter shame burst forth Miss Innes
springing to her feet in her vehemence

Im afraid from what he says that it has just about broken poor old
Nin The last straw you know

Olwen sat down again as suddenly as she had uprisen Her very knees were
shaking Perhaps Wolf saw that she could not speak for he filled in
the pause glibly

I wonder whether when you were at the Pele you ever heard the odd
storylegend I should sayof the Bulldrop

She brought back her mind with an effort The Bulldrop

Yes the causeway leading to the Pele There was a tale of a bull
having jumped out of the keep through a breach made by the besiegers
and they prophesied that if such a thing ever happened again there would
be a fair Guyse and the family would recover its old importance

Of course I remember Why of course

Well a curious thing happened just about the time you left us Do you
remember meeting a messengerboy on your way to Raefell As a matter of
fact he had a cablegram for you in his pocket and he told us where to
look for you We questioned him and found that he had seen you on the
road

I remember well

Like all boys he was fascinated by the desire to walk on the parapet
of the causeway It was in a bad state for the long frost had caked
the old snow upon it so thickly that the rains had not removed all of
it He slipped and fell into the ravine

Was he killed

Not a bit of it He fell quite near the farther end among the
underbrush on the slope However he broke a rib or two and was pretty
bad But the funny part of the story is that when we put the chap to
bed and sent for the doctor we discovered that his name was Tommy
Bull

As he hoped this story diverted her attention from the consideration of
Ninians tragedy

Bull It seems like the fulfilment of the prophecy Oh what did Sunia
say

She was perfectly certain that it was as you say the fulfilment of
prophecy She was so completely reassured by it that she was able to
bear up under the sale of the Pele and the departure of her sahib for
the war She said that things must come right it was merely a question
of waiting But I think she has lost heart at last This latest blow
is too heavy

You saydid you tell methat the tower is actually sold I mean that
Lord Caryngston has actually sold it

I believe not He wrote to warn Ninian that it was to be sold and he
mentioned that he had already had an offer of more than he gave Of
course he is breaking his contract but he knows Nin has no money to
fight him

No but Mr Guyse is in the Pele and possession is nine points of the
law cried Olwen passionately If I were he I would decline to turn
out and surely the Courts would support him if anybody tried to evict
him

He shrugged his shoulders Maybe Maybe not I dont believe the
conditions made are legally binding He trusted to Caryngstons
honour

She sat hands locked together mind so busy that it seemed to whirl

Does Mr Guyse know thatthat you and I have met she asked at length

No I didnt say anything about it Its a sore subject you see He
has never got over your turning him down As the colour flew to her
cheeks he added I beg pardon I had no right to say that

It is hardly accurate moreover Mr Guyse only offered to marry me in
order to satisfy a somewhat fantastic sense of honour He would have
been much surprised had I taken advantage of his proposal

Wolfs most expressive glance was upon her I wonder if you expect me
to believe that he asked mischievously

Olwen drew herself up Whether you believe it or not hardly concerns
me Colonel Guyse

He shrugged his shoulders Well you are a person of importance now
said he and can take your pick of the fortunehunters I can tell you
one thing however You will never find a man among them fit to tie up
old Nins shoestring But I had better say Goodbye before I offend
past forgiveness

He rose and held out his hand Then we meet at eleven tomorrow
morning he said

She let him go scarcely heeding what she did The world was upside
down and she wanted time in which to readjust her ideas When he had
left the room she went towards the door almost as though she were
blind groping for the handle Just as she emerged upon the landing the
parlourmaid came up from the hall bearing a note upon a salver

It had been delivered by hand and was marked Urgent

She carried it up with her to her room locked herself in flung down
the envelope on her toilettable and herself upon the bed

Floods of tears came to her relief and for a while she lay there
helpless overswept by a torrent of feeling while a host of plans
hopes wishes fears thrills careered madly through her mind

Not until the first bell reminded her that Parkinson would be arriving
almost immediately to dress her for dinner did she arise and going to
the glass to survey the ravages of the past hours emotion remark the
note lying on the jewel tray

It did not look at all important She expected one of the appeals which
reached her with distressing frequency from some impecunious person who
had heard she was celebrated for her kind and feeling heart The
contents were surprising It was dated from an address at Finchley and
written in a pretty ladylike hand


DEAR MADAMPardon my troubling you but as Colonel Guyse seems to be
very often at your house I am writing to inform you of what you may not
knownamely that he is a married man I saw you talking to him in
Regent Street the other day and I have watched him since If you need
proof I can show you my marriage lines but if you show him this letter
he wont deny it We were married in Canada years ago and I adored him
so that I fell in with his idea that to have his marriage with me known
would spoil his whole future Now I feel that I have had enough of it
He has a Colonels pay and he ought to acknowledge me instead of which
he says he is going to reduce my allowance I have come up to London
unknown to him for when he said he was going to cut me short I guessed
there was something going on I feel I must put a spoke in his wheel
before it is too late I have borne a great deal but if he thinks he
is going to deceive a nice young girl like you who has done good all
through the war he is mistaken My cousin from Canada was one of the
boys you nursed and I dont forget it Write to me if you like but if
you are the girl I take you for this letter ought to do the trickYours
truly LILY GUYSE


Lily Guyse There was but little need to inquire what the ladys maiden
name had been She was Lily Martin and the face which Olwen had
noticed as Wolf took leave of her in Regent Street was the face she had
seen between the leaves of a book in the Pele library

Wolfs wife




 CHAPTER XXXIV

 THE MILECASTLE AGAIN


Messrs Green Son  Wilkinson who had the care of Miss Inness legal
affairs were much inclined to advise her to think more than twice
before purchasing a Border Pele In like manner they had striven to
persuade her not to face the tremendous expenditure of running a private
hospital The result was the same in both cases Miss Innes as she
gently pointed out was no longer a child She was now well on in her
twenties and when she had made up her mind to do a thing she did it
She did not come to them for Advice but to have her orders carried out

They told her that the land to be sold with the tower was inconsiderable
and of poor quality The Pele itself needed to have a large sum laid
out upon it in order to make it fit for residence The country was
exposed the distance from the railway great the difficulties of water
supply and electric light alike formidable

She listened smiled said she knew the place well and had set her
heart upon it She declined to entertain the idea of a lease would buy
only the freehold and stipulated that the present tenant Mr Guyse
should not be told the name of the purchaser

She was perfectly willing to agree to the somewhat stiff terms of sale
namely that she undertook under heavy penalties not to divide the
land not to pull down the Tower not to build cheap houses on the
property and a dozen other restrictions which seemed to her very
absurd but which were none the less insisted upon

There actually was another wouldbe buyer in the market besides
herselfan American and she gave instructions that whatever this
gentleman offered her own representatives should offer more The
result was that although she came off victorious she had to pay more
than Messrs Green Son  Wilkinson thought a fair price

Little cared she

It seemed to her that never had she really grasped the happiness of
being rich until she actually held in her hands the bulky titledeeds
the precious documents which made her the owner of the Pele which gave
Ninians future so to speak into her tyrant hands

It was not until this transaction was accomplished that she realised how
completely she had burnt her boats The capital sum paid down must
appreciably cripple her own income Suppose that her worst fears were
truethat Ninian had never loved her and did not want herwhat was she
to do

What would the rest of life be like after she had made over the Pele to
him

She shut her ears to all such maddening thoughts She was going to see
him or die in the attempt

He has never got over your turning him down So Wolf had said
That might however easily be true even though he had no spark of love
for her Had she accepted him his home need never have been sold
Here was matter enough for regret from his point of view It must be
the loss of the fortune and not the woman that he lamented Wolfs lip
had curled as he said You can have your pick of the fortunehunters
now Youll not find a man among them fit to tie up old Nins
shoestring In her heart she admitted the exact truth of this

As soon as she received Lily Guyses letter she determined not to see
Wolf again for the present She coaxed Aunt Maud to leave town and
they went to a hotel a few miles out whence she could easily motor in
and interview her lawyers During the time that the negotiations were
pending she was in a state of mind so unlike herself that Miss Wilson
confided to General Grey her wish that Olwen would take a fancy to
somebody and marry soon If she doesnt she will be quite soured
said she with a sigh

Is there anybody he asked

Not that I know of I always had an idea that there was something or
somebody but it was while she was staying away There was a young
doctorit is possible she is fretting for him I thought that very
irresistible Colonel Guyse might have a chance but somehow I dont
fancy he has made much impression I suppose the poor child feels that
everybody must be after her money

Oh but she is attractive She need not feel that She is a girl who
would always have had lovers

Yes indeed Mr Holroyd would have married her long before anybody
dreamed she would be rich But I am glad she did not care for him He
is not the husband for her she wants a more dominant person for she is
very wilful and impetuous

The wilfulness and impetuosity of her niece were more clearly
demonstrated in the course of a very few days Miss Innes announced her
intention of starting upon a tour in the north of England

Miss Wilson was seriously annoyed She was wrapped up in her own
affairs at the time very busy every moment occupied London full
plenty of interest the General just in the stage when a man may or may
not go further according to opportunity

What has made you all of a sudden turn against London she asked with
natural vexation You were wild to come here at first

I know One has to find out ones mistakes and I have found out mine
There are disadvantages that I never foresaw One is the way in which
men keep on asking me to marry them without caring one bit for me and
expect me to take their devotion for granted

Nonsense Olwen

It isnt nonsense I wish they wouldnt do it I said to Mr Lambert
only the other day You dont know what love means you havent any
idea I am younger than you but I know and you dont He took me up
very quickly Do you know by personal experience he wanted to know
and I asked him what he meant Has a man made violent love to youhas
he kissed you he asked I told him nobody ever had done that though
five men counting Ben Holroyd have asked me to marry them So he said
I couldnt know But I do so whats the good of arguing Heighho
One man is just the same as another to me and Im sure they all go to
the same tailor

Dont get bitter child

If any of them looked different orweatherstained oreven did things
at a different time from anybody else like the Snark you
knowbreakfasted at five oclock tea and dined on the following day
But in London people are not like that We are just like the
carpetbedding in the parks we look all right in the mass but if you
examine any one of us individually it is a poor little specimen and if
we grew too tall or too big the gardener would snip us and trim us to
make us match the others

Miss Wilson had no reply to make to this and the heiress continued
after a minute

Have you ever heard that if a man brings the girl he loves into a house
where a corpse is lying he will never marry her

Really Ollie what unpleasant things you sometimes say No I never
heard of such a thing

Well I did I believe its true too Superstitions often are They
grow out of wild nature In some parts of the world wild nature is
still alive and strong enough to hurt The elementscold and wind and
snowmight kill you there They have power But for all that you would
be free ever so much more free than we are here where everybodys
thoughts are coloured by the latest novel that everybody else is
reading too

Im really not sure what you are talking about

Oh Im not talking merely thinking aloud You have got to bear that
now and then If you knew how often I brood over things like this and
how seldom I bore you with them you would think yourself lucky I have
just now got a craving for solitude and savagery I want to see a black
crag with a frozen lake at its base and a low grey sky a flurry of
snow the mist blotting out all the rest of the worldand in the midst
of it all just one little place of refuge

At the end of June Im afraid even in the wildest parts of this
country you wont be able to indulge your desire said Aunt Maud with
irony Do you want to go abroad

Nno Only to the north

Well I am afraid I really cant leave town for another fortnight at
least

Then you mustnt think me a beast if I go off without you You can
join me wherever I happen to be cant you You had better let me go
for I shall be poor company I have nothing to do I am at a loose end
and I think if I go somewhere where I can walk and walk and walk till I
am so tired that I drop off to sleep the moment I have eaten my supper
I shall regain a more normal view of life Ill go in the car Aunt
Ethels in town this week and she would love it if I were to motor her
and Marjorie back to Leeds with me and drop them at Mount Prospect on
my way

My child Go travelling alone Grandpapa would not like that

Olwen smiled serenely He wont be asked bless him Dear aunt
consider my advanced age Chaperons and dodos now occupy the same glass
case in most museums Ill take Parkinson and then Heaven knows I shall
be respectable enough

The plans thus made were duly carried through as plans made by Olwen
had a habit of being

Mrs Whitefield since her nieces accession to wealth had varied in
her feelings between envy and a desire to stand well with the heiress
She accepted all favours offered but could not forbear disparaging
criticism She was pleased to travel north in the fine RollsRoyce but
vexed because she could not understand why Ollie should continue her
tour alone instead of taking Marjorie with her Marjorie had grown
stout and was stolid and uninteresting Olwen was kindly disposed to
her but just now she felt that her continual company would be quite
unbearable and breathed a sigh of relief when after spending a night
in the overpowering magnificence of Mount Prospect she was free to
pursue her journey unhindered

She passed by way of Watling Street up to the Tyne pausing when she
reached Corbridge to wander down to the rivers edge and trace the old
line of the great highway through Corstopitum She slept that night at
the Wheatsheaf and early next morning passed through Hexham and
Fourstones to Bardon Mill and thence over the shoulder of Barcombe
The hedgerows as they passed were crimson with the glow of such
brierroses as seem to grow only in Northumbria but when they had
passed Vindolana and the Roman milestone and come out upon Wades Road
they had reached the end of the hedgerows

At the TwiceBrewed Inn they stopped and she left the car with
Parkinson and Goddard the chauffeur to do as they liked until her
return She was going off by herself to slake her desire to behold once
more Dukes Crag and the Hotwells Lough

Over her head was a sky of cloudless blue in which larks sang and
curlews wheeled with their mewing cry over the lonely land She had a
map with her and was able to make straight for the milecastle

She had hardly left the road and set her face northward before she was
out of sight of all habitations Before her on the ridge lay the long
line of the outer vallum and beyond it the swell of the height which
carried the Wall itself and was precipitous upon its northern face

After she had climbed some way she could shading her eyes from the
glare descry far away to her left the smoke from the chimney of Hazel
Crag drifting idly on the warm breeze and she lived again the moment
of the opening door and the face of Balmayne as he recognised the night
wanderers

The cry of sheep straying on the moor came to her ears like a far away
lament

 Silence and passion joy and peace
 An everlasting wash of air
 Romes ghost since her decease 


This was Ninians native land Its freedom its loneliness were alike
typical of him in her mind The short turf on which she trod was
enamelled with the purple and gold of wild pansies Theres pansies
thats for thoughts she found herself whispering and thoughts were
thronging almost unbearably

In the long awful months and years of his captivity how must his wild
heart have turned with sick longing to those broad spaces that
galloping wind that fullness of liberty that crowded solitude of his
native north She had a fantastic notion that for every time he or she
had visited the place in spirit one little thoughtflower had sprung to
bear witness of the dream

She was making for the Gap like a mountain pass in miniature which
brings one through close to the dark Lough The water today looked
temptingly cool and clear Somewhere in its depths lay the stone which
had struck her head She did not descend to the plain beyond her but
turned westward and made her way along the ridge to the milecastle

To her active feet the distance seemed very short in the fair weather
It was hard even to picture the drifting snow like cold foam about
clogged feetthe keenness of the driving blast the furious opposition
of the elements

Her imagination brought Ninian so near that she stopped and faced
quickly about with some idea of being followed There was no one only
the memoryladen landscape looked her in the face whispered in her
ear How he had suffered since then  She used to read in the
papers of the horrors of Griesslauen harrowing details of typhoid of
bad water of half rations of torture Had she known what he was
enduring she never could have borne it The very memory forced drops
from her eyes as she dwelt upon it

She reached the milecastle where it lay open to the sun Over its
broken wall she could descry the corrugated iron roof of the shed which
had sheltered them Her feet were noiseless on the grass and her
approach was unseen unheard by the man who sat within upon a remnant
of inner wall

He was seated sideways so that she saw his profile His head was
downbent his elbows rested on his knees In his hands he held something
which at first she took to be a skein of silk which he was idly pulling
through his fingers His hat lay on the ground beside him and Olwen
saw his hair thickly sprinkled with grey

What was it which his fingers ceaselessly caressed The sun glinted upon
it and it fell in a shower of gold It was a tress of hair

A mixture of amazement joy and wicked triumph so flooded her that she
could hardly see Hair It was her own hair It was the big tress
which to Sunias rage Dr Balmayne had been obliged to cut away in
order to sew the wound on her head

There is no word to describe what she felt as she fought for composure
schooled the trembling of her limbs and the muscles of her mouth

His gaze was fixed upon something which lay on the ground between his
knees something too small for her to see Having made herself ready
for the encounter she let a bit of stone fall with a rattling noise
He looked up

Nin it was but the change in him was at first sight awful

His face was lined and parchmentlike There were puckers about his
eyes which looked sunken He might have passed for ten years older
than Wolf For a long instant his look met hers as though he did not
see her Then suddenly there awoke in his bewildered stare something
that resembled the Ninian she had known With a swift movement he
thrust the tress of hair into his breast pocket snatched up what lay
upon the grass and with a flicker a characteristic glance he opened
fire

Ah well you havent succeeded in growing any taller you know in
spite of all your new dignities His manner at least was unchanged
though his voice sounded forced and unnatural

His words pulled Olwen together wonderfully She had been on the very
verge of selfbetrayalof a burst of silly tears The familiar mocking
seemed to put them back at once just at the place where they left off
and she summoned her strength to fence with him as of old Yes she
replied with a conventional smile not moving forward but speaking
from her post in the entrance I am still a mouse as your brother
reminded me the other day only the country mouse has become a town
mouse

A quiver crossed his face as her voice was heard Oh he said so
you really are are you Ive once or twice thought I saw you before
todayslipping round a corner or peeping over a wall but never face to
face like this How did you get here

My car is waiting at TwiceBrewed I have walked from there and am
very hot I didnt expect to find you here

Obviously not he replied with a grin which showed his teeth to be as
good as ever You looked as if you had found a blackbeetle in the
sugarbasin However Im not a fixture you know As he spoke he
laid down the thing he held in his hand as it were furtively on the
stone at the farther side of him out of sight

Determined to know what this was she came suddenly forward and sank on
the grass at his feet with a flutter of white skirts The manoeuvre
found him unprepared Quickly he covered the little square bit of card
with his hand but her eyes were very keen and she had seen that it was
her own photo She remembered that she had extracted it from a drawer
while at the Pele with the intention of sending it to her father and
had placed it on the mantelshelf in her room She had never noticed the
fact that it was not among the things so carefully packed and returned
after her departure

Now it told her all She found him here in this place sacred to a
memory which she alone could share and with him he brought her picture
and a tress of hair

Her courage rose with one bound for all doubt was solved Her lips
curved with mischief as she looked up at him provocatively bold in the
delightful knowledge that she was prettier than she used to be and that
her clothes set her off to the best advantage

Since you dont ask me to be seated I do so without ceremony

My manners have gone to pieces since I saw you last Pretty annoying
isnt it to think how you wasted time and instruction on me

Oh was her retort Im not surprised I remember you had decided
that you could not keep it up You prepared me for a lapse

Its worse than a lapse Its what you might describe as a dbcle
if you knew as much French as I do

She was below him facing him and she looked up steadily at him as she
replied

Ah well I suppose I shall have to begin all over again

That moved him No by God you dontnot again he answered
defiantly

Do you suppose that you can stop me if my mind is made up

Upon my word you have the cheek of the

Cheek I should think I have Dont be under the impression that you
can browbeat me

If youll take my advice youll run away to that car of yours as fast
as your expensively shod feet will take you Im not good company
today for the wealthy and frivolous

I know you always did find me a bore But you cant get rid of me so
easily as all that I had the intention of coming to the Pele to call
upon Madam but as we have met here perhaps you will take this as a
calllike the two ladies in Punch who met while bathing Now let us
begin to talk properly and remember as much as you can of the nice
manners I once taught you How is your mother Mr Guyse

His face which had changed a dozen times as she teased him settled
into a scowl She is very ill he said gruffly and she is getting
worse Thats a topic I cant joke about

I dont ask you to joke I think you ought to consider it very
seriously Madam needs change of air and scene Why dont you take her
away somewheresay to the Riviera

He looked at her as if he could box her ears with pleasure Oh just
because I dont choose he answered savagely I like to thwart her
just for the sake of thwarting her as you ought to know by this time

I do know but I like to force you to admit it said she with a demure
smile I am wondering whether I could not do something to help cheer
her up I often think with regret of the fact that I refused to do what
she wanted me to do so badly II wonder whether it would do any good
now Or whether it is too late

She pulled a blade of grass from beside her and twisted it round her
fingers carefully keeping her eyes fixed upon it

Afraid I cant help you to a decision he said harshly

Oh yes you can In fact it all depends on you she replied in a
very small voice Do you remember our last talk at the Pelewhen you
came in to tea and I was so kind I had kept yours hot for you and I
stayed to pour it out And do you remember that on that occasion in
the intervals of drinking your tea you did me the honour to ask me to
marry you

Did I I must have been an ass

Well perhaps you were But I really am not sure Perhaps I was the
ass for saying NO Anyway it has been in my mind that I ought to have
said Yes on account of Madam Dont you agree

He sprang to his feet Not in the humour today for any more twaddle
he said laughing with a catch in his breath II know Ive been a
beast andand drawn this on myself but have a little pity for me This
morning Ive heard that the last blow has fallen Im now not merely a
beggar but an outcast I cant sit bandying words with you I tell you
I cant stand it

She did not move but answered with a quiet which disarmed him Well
I wont keep you long but as we have met I wish you would just put up
with me for a few minutes longer You have roused all my curiosity and
I think you ought to satisfy it What do you mean by saying that you
are not merely a beggar but an outcast

Just what I say When I did the one thing I shall regret all my life
and asked you to marry me I did think I had something to offer a woman
Now Ive nothing It is sold over my headthe Pele I meanand I shall
have to take Madam on my back and tramp the country asking the
charitable for shelter

He had sunk down in his place again and sat there eyes fiercely fixed
on the contemplation of his troubles

Oh Nin she said softly dont you think even having to marry me
might be better than that It does sound so uncomfortable for poor
Madam

He looked at her marvelling at her cruelty and made a shrinking
movement as if hurt Out there he said after a pause out in
Griesslauen I used to think I had endured everything a man could and
that hereafter I might reckon myself immune to pain But II expect you
have the right If you get any satisfaction out of baiting me go on
Its up to me to take what you give

She rose deliberately from where she had been sitting and went away a
few paces He raised his head She had gone to the door of the shed in
which they had sheltered and stood staring in After a while she turned
slowly and caught his look fixed upon her The colour flowed warm over
her face

Perhaps said she in a low voice perhaps your mother was right
Itit was very unconventional wasnt it Do you thinkperhapson those
groundsI was wrong to say No

He stood up and his face was rigidly set I think you had better go
was all he said

She turned to him looking not into his face but somewhere about his
second waistcoat button So you wont marry me on Madams accountnor
because it would be more comme il faut Would you marry menow tell
the truthif by doing so you could get back the Pele

No he shouted wrathfully No no and yet again no I wouldnt
marry you if you were hung all over with silver and goldnot if you were
Venus and Diana rolled into one

Well well well you neednt make such a noise about it Im not a
bit deaf

He broke off seeming to swallow rage in gulps For a moment he
surveyed her critically as if he sneered at her fine clothes then he
turned abruptly on his heel Goodbye he said shortly making for
the entrance




 CHAPTER XXXV

 TWIXT CUP AND LIP


Oh please wait a minute said his tormentor I have a great deal
more to say before we part

He halted though chafing against himself for displaying such weakness
and stood his hands in his pockets glowering at her small figure
instinct with energy erect in the sunny enclosure framed by the grey
stones

She smiled at him a rapt kind of smile seeming more occupied with her
own thoughts than with him

Oh doesnt it all look different she asked

I dont know quite what you mean but everything is differentthe whole
world is changed since you and I were last here

Yes Utterly changed The only thing that remains the same is just
the very thing I thought would have changed most

And that is

You

Ah well if you think so that only shows what a little duffer you
must be he snapped

All right Im a duffer now That is a change since you used to look
up to me or pretend you did However it doesnt much matter I want
you to do me a very small favour Walk back with me to TwiceBrewed

No fear What for

Ill explain I am doing a little tour up in the northnobody is with
me but my maid I was intending to call at the Pele tomorrow to leave
something therea little present for Madam andand you You were very
kind to me when I was with you and I was so ill afterwards that you
never got properly thanked Now it occurs to me that as we have met I
can motor you home going on afterwards to Caryngston where I am to
stay the night I have written to the Seven Spears and Mrs Askwith
expects me By the way how were you going to get home if I had not met
you

On my feet of course

Well you may as well come in the car instead

He considered her half angry half amused You and your car

She laughed out gaily It does seem absurd doesnt it But you might
come and look at it Its such a nice one Dont be disagreeable

I never need make any effort in that direction It comes natural

It doesnt You cultivate it because you think its clever but you
are completely mistaken Now come along and be thankful I can go on my
own feet today instead of having to make use of yours

Im not sure theres any cause for thankfulness in that

Oh you are perverse You must have got out of bed the wrong side
this morning I wonder how I put up with you but you see I feel a
little responsible Having begun your education and then allowed it to
lapse the least I can do is to be patient with you

I have frequently met with assurance he remarked but for sheer
brazen impudence I certainly never met your equal

And I dont think you ever will she replied as though highly
complimented

Her feet went dancing over the heathery grass mauve with harebells
Her heart was beating so wildly that she wondered if it could be
audible She had to fight her impulse to turn and cling to him as he
strode beside her gaunt and bony the marks of suffering plainly on
him but Nin stillthe same Nin She refrained however There was
something delicious in the present moment She wanted to prolong
itwanted to know what he would do when he found out that the Pele was
his

Suddenly he spoke Well it will as a matter of fact be a
convenience to me to get back home quickly said he for I have to put
myself inside a tail coat and go and dine with the Kendalls

The Kendalls she cried  and in the extremity of her surprise the
next words came out without her own consent Why what in the world do
they want with you now

He grinned in the way she knew so well You may well ask Perhaps you
havent heard of poor Noels death That leaves me heir to the rotten
title worse luck

Nin said a low changed voice from under her hat tell me the truth
Are you engaged to her

There was a long dreadful pause Yes he said at last I think I
am That is her father has given his consent Thats what I am going
over about tonight

And youand youyou could bearto come up herewith that in your
mind

I came up here he answered heavily to say goodbye to a dream

They went on for some way in silence She told herself that no
wellconducted young woman could venture farther than she had done in
the direction of encouragement The light went out of the skies her
step flagged she could have cast herself upon the grass and wept Yet
for very pride she could not say Jilt her marry me Had he not
sworn with energy that nothing would induce him to marry her

Well said she at last primly I can but hope you will be very
happy

Happy he said with a fierce little snort

Theres one drawback Sunia doesnt like her Sunia does like me You
dont know how many times I have longed for her my present maid is a
kind of fish she never entertains me with spells or mesmerising or
fortunetelling or any of the devices to make time pass agreeably of
which Sunia is mistress I wonder whether I could tempt her with very
high wages to come to me and desert Madam

She wont desert me even when Miss Kendall is her mistress

I dont think you need build on that Miss Kendall wont keep her a
month

Jove I never thought of that

Well I hope you will under the circumstances excuse my having
proposed marriage to you this afternoon I can only say in extenuation
that I had no idea your affections were already engaged or I would have
been more discreet Why here we are already within sight of the inn
What a little way down it really is A couple more fields and we are on
the road Goddard must have seen us coming down he has brought the car
along I see

They spoke only trivialities until they reached the gate which the
chauffeur held open

Olwen came out in a kind of dream She felt as if she had been to a
function which she imagined was a wedding and it had turned out as
sometimes in nightmare to be a funeral after all

She addressed Ninian with a selfpossessed smile asking him to sit by
Goddard and direct him Then she got into the car with Parkinson who
proceeded to remove her mistresss widebrimmed hat and tie her up in
her motorbonnet as they sped along

It was past five by the time they reached the little road that branched
off to the Pele Olwen stopped the car

It is getting so late that as you have to dress Mr Guyse I will not
call upon Madam this afternoon said she I shall hope to give myself
that pleasure another time if I ever come back to this neighbourhood
which perhaps is not very likely Meanwhile may I trouble you to
carry this parcel to her It is really a present for you but I think
she may share in its enjoyment Give her my kind remembrances
Goodbye

Tonguetied before the two servants he made his adieux Now it was he
whose eyes eagerly sought for a glance from hers but in vain She felt
as if one look would break down her pride and that she would show some
inkling of what she was enduring As on the day when he had put her
into the train at Raefell they parted with barely a farewell In a
couple of minutes the car had become a dark speck upon the moor road to
Caryngston

 She had but just glimpsed the grey towerhad hardly ventured even a
glance so sorely did she fear to give herself away Now she leaned
back in her corner drawing down her veil to hide the drops that swam in
her eyes yet not daring to give way or to relieve her feelings by any
sign of what she was going through

Caryngston in summertime was quite an attractive village Over the
porch of the Seven Spears clambered a Gloire de Dijon rose On the long
benches outside the doors sat the hardbitten northern farmers enjoying
the restful moment Deb stood in the porch and her eyes lit up as she
recognised the little lady who had come in the snow upon an evening now
far back in the mists of that antique period usually alluded to as
before the war

As they entered the passage whose very wallpaper was unchanged each
moment each event of the former occasion revived with poignant
freshness

Deb had plenty to say the whole war news of the village to give Her
young daughter had married the bootmakers son the first time ever he
came home on leave She pointed out the house now inhabited by the
reunited couple And shes a deal luckier than the most of em Her
mans only short of one foot and thats no matter for the boot trade
It was a comfort to find her so absorbed in what she had to impart as
not to be very inquisitive concerning Olwens own affairs after once
she had expatiated upon the wonderful fate that had befallen the yoong
lass in having all that brass bequeathed to her

Supper was presently partaken of and removed At last about halfpast
eight Olwen was left alone in the depths of that armchair where once
she had sat swelling with resentment at Nins impertinence She had
told Parkinson to go to bed and was therefore free to indulge unnoticed
in the luxury of red eyes Her tears flowed fast

What folly had been hers She had spent such a sum of money as
following on her large disbursements throughout the war would make a
real difference to herand this in order to bestow the Pele upon Rose
Kendall the odious girl who had treated Mrs Guyses companion with
studied insolence Yet she gave thanks that she had given it In the
first passionate tumult of mortification upon hearing of his
engagement she had been tempted to withhold the gift She had put that
temptation by Having started to right a wrong she could give Nin the
one thing he wished to have even though her own happiness proved to
have been permanently lost She had misjudged him she had been
ungenerous undiscriminating and for this she desired to make amends
Ninian at a time when he knew her father to be dead and his own
discreditable secret safe had yet confessed She in return at a time
when she knew him to be about to marry another woman and her own
happiness to be lost yet held to her resolution to make him once more
master of the Pele

By this deed she felt that she proved herself worthy of him

Though they would never see each other again yet there would lie
between them the memory of high things It would make a sanctuary of
life in the futurethat future which loomed before her so long and so
dark As the slow minutes dragged on she fancied Ninian and his
betrothed sitting togetherleft alone no doubt by considerate parents
so that they might make love

Such are the torments of jealousy that Miss Innes was quite exhausted by
their keenness

He had never made love to her He had never kissed her

If ever she had hated anyone she hated Rose Kendall at that moment

She felt as if ages had passed when she began to hear the stir which
indicated the closing of the inn for the night the sound of the kitchen
fire being raked out benches pushed back voices raised and dying in
the distance the opening and shutting of doors The hoofs of a horse
clattered on the paved market stones and ceased abruptly Deb rattled
some crockery in a cupboard and her husband on the other side of the
house turned a great key in a lock

Olwen must go to bed She lifted a drenched handkerchief and wiped away
the drops which still fell fast She had extinguished the lamp and was
sitting in the dark Thus she might slip past Deb without exciting
remark

The door opened She spoke trying to use a natural voice Its all
right Mrs Askwith I am not gone to bed but I am justgoing

The door shut as softly as swiftly as it had opened The person who had
entered moved round the table in the gloom and came close standing over
her as she cowered back into the depths of the big old porters chair




 CHAPTER XXXVI

 IN THE DARK


She heard the breathing of one who has ridden hard and far and right
through her there shuddered a thrill so exquisite that for a moment she
could not move She was on the point of springing up flinging herself
into those unseen arms when she heard his voice low and mocking

You little wretchyou treacherous minx Dont you think you are the
limit

As in the milecastle she had but the time it took him to deliver
himself of this courteous address in which to meet the challenge She
did it however If she died for it he should not know that she had
been sitting there crying for the moon until her eyes were all swelled
and her hanshif drenched

You must have left your dinner engagement very early Mr Guyse It is
barely ten oclock However as I have been travelling all day I am
very tired and I will ask you to excuse me

You may ask but you wont get excused he said rapidly What the
dickens are you sitting in the dark for I want to see your wicked
faceto see the conscious guilt steal over it How dare you Oh how
dare you insult me as you have insulted me today With a sudden
change of tone he added after a moments breathless silence How could
you plan such a fiendish vengeance

Vengeance How fatiguing you are said she languidly What
vengeance should I want I am giving you what you love most in the
world You always have wanted itdont deny it You would even almost
have married me in order to secure it Only I bored you so utterly
However if you are talking about insults I dont think I can beat the
one you have offered me You couldnt bring yourself to marry me but
you can bring yourself to marry a poll parrot like that Kendall thing
Oh do go away I wonder I have the patience to talk to you at all

I wonder I have the patience not to shake you  Do you happen to
know where there are some matches

Ill call Deb and ask for some 

She rose from the depths of the chair and found her hands held

Why youre as cold as a stone Sitting alone in the dark and the
coldyoure actually shivering

Thats with rage not cold Good night Mr Guyse Sorry I cant stop
and talk to you but you pay your calls at unseemly hours

Olwen It seemed he was in earnest at last He had never before
called her by her name Could you really be so stupid so utterly
unlike yourself as to imagine that I should accept that deed of gift

She gave a little low chuckle You cant help accepting it silly

Havent you got the sense to see that it must be all or nothing between
me and you

Well the choice lies with you I suppose

You suppose nothing of the kind he cried in exasperation You know
that all is out of the question so it must be nothing from you to
meMiss Innes

He was so near her that the warmth and energy of him seemed to enfold
her His breath still came fastand no wonder The distance between
Caryngston and the Pele though easy in a motor was a long hard ride
She knew that he could not have been at the Kendalls at all She felt
that he was within an ace of sheer explosion yet still he resisted
Would nothing break down his pride

Ninshe threw all the appeal she could into her voiceNin what do
you mean Why do you say that it is out of the question for me to give
youall

Because you dont love me

Indeed And what about you You dont love me either

He gave a rough sort of laugh as if of utter scorn You unprincipled
woman Here I have had enough of this bopeep I am going to make a
light

He let go her hands to feel in his pocket for matches and instantly she
made a dart to get past him He gave an exclamation

No you dont dropped the matchbox and caught her as she fledcaught
her in both arms held her a breathless moment in silence breathing
hard Then with a muttered ejaculation which sounded like Thats done
it he bent his head down to where he supposed the top of her head to
be She had flung back her throat and instead of the hair he meant to
kiss he found her lips

     

Well its your fault You shouldnt have said I didnt love you
Such an obvious lie now wasnt it

The dark still enfolded them She lay in his arms but she could not
answer Life had gone past speech

What is it he whispered Are you angry Have I hurt you

He had to bend very close to catch what she said

At last

At last he echoed but girls are the very queerest Why on earth if
you felt like this did you treat me in the old days as though you
wouldnt have anything to do with me

Oh Nin it would take such ages to explain II couldnt even begin
yet ImIm too completely muddled Hadnt you better put me down
now

His hold did not slacken You are such a willothewisp that I dread
letting you go in case you slip away into the dark as you used to do
when I dreamed of you at Griesslauen Let me sit in the big chair and
hold you as I did in the milecastlemy little whitecrane lady His
odd voice held the tenderest shyest noteboth tones so new to her that
they caused delicious shivers to pass through her as if at a caressing
touch He sat down as he had suggested cradling her head against him
and added with a choky laugh Gad perhaps its as well it happened in
the dark so that you could forget the kind of scarecrow I have turned
into You saw today though up on the moor You once told me that I
looked like a demon An elderly demon isnt at all a charming sight I
should suppose

She slipped an arm about his neck You have altered I wont deny it
But you are going to get back all your looks Wait till you have had a
six months honeymoon Even Sunia wont know you at the end And there
her control gave way and she began to sob When I thinkwhen I
thinkwhat you have gone through

It was bad But its over Yes it was pretty bad We wont talk of
it now You see I was only a private I went and enlisted in the
Gordons because I had no previous military experience There wasnt a
hope of my getting a commission and I wanted to get out there quick
So I did I was out of England into France and out of France into
Germany before you could say Knife  Well if Germany is going to
receive retribution at the hands of Providence for all her misdeeds
its likely to be a good while before shes through

You are not to think of such things now but to listen to me There is
one thing I simply must know When you looked up today and saw me
standing there in the milecastle what did you think Now dont tease
boy tell me really

I would if I could but I cant I felt as if I couldnt feel
anything The only idea left was a determination to keep my end up

And I was just as determined to break you down

Much you know about it Break me down with your flippant LeapYear
proposals which merely shocked me  That was what made me run over
my whole list of ammunition and hit upon Rose Kendall

Nin Two hands which small though they may have been were still
decidedly vigorous went round his throat Were you having me on
Tell the truth now

I cant if you choke me Well yes and no I was and I wasnt It
is not true that I am engaged to her but they have been letting me see
that they would be pleased enough if it came about I was thinking that
by going there this evening I was perhaps committing myself Anyway I
thought it just possible that if I threw that stone it might hit you and
hurt you and I wanted to hurt you as much as I possibly could because
I knew I could never ask you and you had shown such incredible
effrontery in asking me You really did deserve

But Nin you are a perfect owl If you thought I should mind being
told you were engaged to the pollparrot how can you say you thought I
didnt care for you

Oh I dont know Werent you sticking pins into me all over

She laid her cheek close against his Effrontery she echoed with a
gleeful chuckle Yes I was rather outrageous wasnt I Your
prunesprism schoolmarm asking you right out to marry her But you
see you had given yourself away completely I saw you some minutes
before you knew I was there  and I saw what you had in your hand

She boldly plunged her hand into his coat pocket but found nothing

He laughed Not there not there my child I cant show it you
without pulling off my coat and rolling up my sleeve Ive got a
bracelet of bright hair about the bone like the chap in Donnes verses
 it went to Griesslauen with me Kiddie this is too good to be
true How nice and soft your cheek is against mine Just like a peach
Does mine feel scratchy Bum isnt it that it should be such bliss to
rub them against each other Oh Jove Heres Mother Deb

They had but a moment to regain their feet before the sleepy landlady
was upon them bearing a candle in her hand

All in the dark Then he must have gone she began and broke off to
continue in a shocked voice Muster Nin its time you was agoing

Youll have to put me up here tonight Deb and tomorrow yoong
lassll be away oop to t Pele with me Were going to get wed yoong
lass and me What dyou think o that




 CHAPTER XXXVII

 VINDICATED


In the gay morning air the car rushed over the high plain carrying two
lovers to the grim Pele

Olwen had informed Parkinson that she was going to stay a few days with
Mrs Guyse but that she must leave her behind as she was not sure of
there being the necessary accommodation She therefore wished her to
remain at the Seven Spears until further orders As a fact she felt
most uncertain of the treatment her maid would be likely to receive at
the hands of the ayah

Parkinson listened grimly with an offended air that made Miss Innes
feel that a months notice must be impending She hoped it was for she
knew that this woman could never be an inmate of her future home

Early that morning Ezra had ridden into Caryngston upon one of the farm
horses He came to bring news of the sudden grave increase of Madams
illness and to fetch Dr Balmayne

Olwens experience of sickness gained so recently caused her to be
very prompt in action She telegraphed to Newcastle for a nurse begged
Dr Balmayne to send his car to Picton Bars to bring her up when she
arrived and offered to take him now to the Pele in her own fast car
and to send him back by the same means

She also insisted that Ninian should telegraph to Wolf the news of his
mothers condition before leaving the town

There was embarrassment on both sides at the first meeting between Miss
Innes and the doctor especially when Ninian at her special request
announced to him the fact of their engagement

He warmly congratulated the bridegroom elect but was unable to feel
that the lady was to be congratulated However he concealed his opinion
as best he could Having regard as much to his feeling as to their own
Olwen placed him beside Goddard on the journey so that Nin and she
might sit together The night seemed to have worked a miracle in her
lover The light had come back to his eye the glow to his cheek he
looked ten years younger already as she assured him when she came down
to breakfast and found him hungrily in wait for her He commenced the
days amenities by the remark that he hardly knew which he wanted most
his girl or his breakfast

I object to being lifted up like a baby said she reprovingly as she
smoothed her rumpled hair after his fervent greeting

I always did think what fun it would be to carry you about was the
unabashed reply I very nearly tried that last evening at the Pele
when you declared you had a great mind to say Yes

If you had Win I should never have run away she whispered You
could have held me with one hand with a word a look You knew that
didnt you

No I didnt I only knew that I couldnt somehow I had to let you
go But in my heart I thoughtif you did careand Sunia kept on telling
me you didthat you would forgive me Oh my aunt if you knew how I
hoped and craved and expected day after day It never dawned on me that
you would drop me utterly I dont know what I expected but not that

If you had known beforehand that I should drop you utterly would you
still have told Grandpapa

Oh I had to tell him in any case he answered simply

She then described how her grandfather had received from him the
impression that he felt no attachment to her but had been tempted only
by her fortune She made him understand something of her own agony of
humiliation and of what she had gone through before her impulsive
flight

He had no idea that Madam had told her of her own loveless marriageof
how another Ninian Guyse had wedded her for her fortune It was always
running in my head the girl confessed I could never forget the exact
words she usedHe was as deep in debt as I in love You can
understand how exactly it seemed to apply

The thing I thought you would find it hardest to forgive said he if
you ever found it out was our tampering with your correspondence I
loathed the necessity but having once started on the beastly plot it
had to be done thoroughly for we knew we had very little timeyou must
hear before long that you were an heiress which would shut my
mouthand after all our care the one letter which gave the show away
came straight to your hands through Dr Balmayne I think the knowledge
of that was what made me throw up the dirty game I said Providence is
taking care of this little girl Am I such a hound as to interfere

It was too late then was her low reply You had done the mischief

I somehow felt that it was so wild as it sounded It seemed
impossible to believe that you were not feeling something of the storm
that was shaking me I thought if I could take you and hold you tight
I might make you believe in me even when I had told you the truth But
you were too wise

Too cowardly

Too well protected by guardian angels

So they talked and by the time they reached the tower they had talked
out all remnants of misunderstanding

Mrs Baxter had been on the watch for the doctors car and came out
into the courtyard Her face as she saw who sat with the master was a
curious study

Why if it isnt oor yoong leddy said she staring

Olwen lifted out like a doll by Ninian and set down upon the stones
ran to the good woman and gave her gay greeting

Oh I am glad to see you Hows poor Madam

A little easierlike this morning was the answer Nin went off at
once to take the doctor upstairs after asking Mrs Baxter to show
Goddard where to keep the car and to provide for his sleeping
accommodation

Wheres ayah asked Olwen eagerly

She was upstairs with Madam said Mrs Baxter Olwen guessed that Nin
would send her down but without telling her who was awaiting her In
fact this was just what he did

Youre wanted below ayah he said to her when Balmayne had been
ushered into the sick room

Olwen stood in the hall talking softly to Mrs Baxter and noiselessly
the curtains parted and the little brown face framed in its saree made
its appearance

The Hindu stopped short For a moment the surprise was overwhelming
She had wondered what had come to her sahib dashing off on horseback
quite late in the evening and not returning all nighta thing he had
not done since she could remember Just now as he spoke to her
upstairs the light in his eyes the thrill in his voice had moved her
as she had not been moved since first he had come home from his German
prison broken changed despairing

Here stood the answer to the puzzle and in a swift moment Sunia was on
her knees holding Olwens hands kissing them repeatedly murmuring
soft Hindustani words of caressing

Ah Sunia you have been at your wicked spells laughed the girl all
the time I have been away I have heard you calling calling never
ceasing I have struggled hard but I am here at lastand I am never
never going away again

The woman threw up her hands with a wild gesture Oh Missee my
Missee if only one little weekfew days ago You come too late My
sahib lost his castle He never be really happy now even with you

Im so vain that I think he would be really happy even without the
castle as long as he had me But never mind dear it isnt too late
He has got back his old tower all right I was in time only just in
time

For the first time she saw Sunia overpowered Sinking to the floor the
woman wrapped herself in the folds of her saree and her thin form shook
with the intensity of her feeling

Sunia softly said Olwen presently do you feel better Can you
listen

The woman raised her face all quivering And I ask my gods to curse
my Missee she cried in anguish

Well but they knew I didnt deserve to be cursed so they took no
notice cried Olwen playfully Here I am alive and well and all the
rest of my life I am just going to try and make your sahib happy Now
you must wipe your eyes and get up because I have brought my luggage
with me and I am going to stay here

Sunia bounded to her feet Ayah dear laughed the soft little voice
I am rich now very rich and I have a maid who waits on me May I
send for her to come and be my maid here

Violent rage transformed Sunias face She not come here muttered
she I see to my Missee I dress my Missee for her wedding

You shall I promise you replied the girl fairly hugging the little
woman


It was a busy day They had the nurse installed by soon after midday
and at about three Olwen was admitted to kiss and smile at her future
motherinlaw

Mrs Guyse was looking terribly ill and thin but she was fully
conscious and evidently took great pleasure in the sight of the girl

Olwen told her that she must make haste and get strong enough to be
moved so that she could go away to the south of Europe and grow quite
well Would she not like that Wolf could take her while Nin and she
went for their wedding journey

Madam seemed quite pleased and smiled but there was a curious
expression in her eyes as she turned them on the girl She pressed the
hand that held hers You are good and kind my child We treated you
very badly You have returned good for evil and I could not bear for
you to beunhappy

Unhappy dear I hope there is little chance of that Nobody in the
world was ever so happy as I

I have been very ill said Madam faintly and that makes one think
I have lain here and thought  and there is something  something
you ought to know Will you send Nin to me my dear

Dont you think urged Olwen that you should wait until you are
stronger It is very likely that Nin will tell me the thing you have in
mind We have had so little time as yet to talk things over Try not
to worry

Madam hesitated Well perhaps But I think he will not tell you He
has never told me often as I have begged him to However you can ask
him Ask himas a message from metell him that I adjure him before
marrying you to tell you the truth aboutabout Lily Martin

Lily Martin Her name had vanished from Olwens very thoughts That
story which had so occupied her mind formerly as to blot out any other
idea had now receded into the dim background However she hastened to
reassure Madam Dear he told me all about that long long ago while
I was here

Madam smiled I think not

Olwens heart beat To Madam in her weak state she dare not say
anything of what she knew The patient lay still for a few minutes
then in a weak voice gave some directions Olwen was to find a key
unlock the bureau in Madams sittingroom take thence a dispatchbox
open that and bring the envelope it contained to her

Carefully carrying out instructions the girl easily found the required
paper and brought it to the bedside

Open itlook whispered Madam

Olwen drew from the envelope another which had been partially burned
This was the remains of a letter which had been through the post It
was thus addressed


Mrs Ninian Guyse
 3 Lockerbie Terra
 Southamp


The remains of the address had been burned away She looked at it in
some bewilderment

The day that Miss Martin tried to kill herself she burnt a lot of old
letters in the billiardroom grate whispered the sick woman I came
in and found this which had fallen out of the fire I picked it up
thinking that some daysome dayI would have the truth from Ninian I
hid it carefully and was thankful it was I who found it If there had
been an inquest it would have been terribly strong evidence As it
was it all passed off I suppose he has been keeping her ever since
and that is how he gets rid of so much money but I have never spoken to
him of it

Is it his writing asked the girl

Yes

I will talk to him about it said Olwen quietly but I think you may
be certain that he is not to blame

If I could be In other ways he has been a good son in spite of his
odd manner You really love him in spite of his manners my dear

Because of them I believe laughed the girl bending to kiss her and
to hide the colour in her cheeks I wouldnt change him

She said nothing to Ninian of what had passed until after tea that
evening They had it in the diningroom and grew very foolish over
their memories of the last time they had shared the function

Afterwards resisting the lure of his desire to play and be silly like
two children she told him there was something she must speak about of
a not particularly pleasant character and that she demanded his full
attention

Madam surprised me today she went on by speaking on a subject
which I would far rather were not mentioned between us but what she
said makes it necessary that the whole matter should be cleared up She
and you have never understood each other You think she loves you less
than Wolf because she has a feeling of resentment against you for
making her live here contrary to her inclination But thats only
partly true She has something else to charge you with and she has told
me what it is

He was evidently surprised and asked for an explanation with all the
seriousness that she could desire

Before I say anything of what Madam showed me today she continued
I want you to read a letter which reached me in London some days ago
Its contents may not be news to you I am inclined to suppose that they
are not The affair had faded from my mind for the thought of you
drives out everything else but after what your mother said I am sure
you ought to know the whole truth

So saying she put into his hands the letter she had received from the
cidevant Lily Martin

She watched his face with acute curiosity as he read and she could see
that he was unprepared for what he found

Wolfs wife  That girl was all he said but his voice expressed
extreme distaste

Laying down the letter he propped his chin on his hands and puckered
his mouth into a soundless whistle then flinging himself back in his
chair This is a facer for me he muttered

Leaning forward she laid a hand caressingly on his forehead stroking
back the hair Nin did you know nothing of it

He shrugged his shoulders Honestly no I didnt I dont say that I
didnt know he was in some matrimonial scrape for I did If it hadnt
been that he was not free he wouldnt have allowed me to have the first
innings with you He was awfully fed up about that He has drained me
of every penny I could spare and most of those I couldnt spare in
order to continue her allowance He always said she was consumptive
and that it was only an affair of a few years I never knew it was Lily
Martin Why she must have been married to him when she first came to
us Help

There was consternation in his accents Olwen looked into the depths of
his eyes so limpid and boyish How could she ever have thought this
man untrustworthy

After a while she produced the burnt envelope telling him where his
mother had found it

To her relief he seemed to attach small importance to it

If she is really Wolfs wife he said absently that explains things
She wrote Mrs Ninian Guyse on the back of a photo which she must have
left by accident in the pages of a book I thought when I found it that
it was just her confounded cheek but she had right on her side You
know that Ninian is the typical Guyse name in our senior branch of the
family Thus my father named his twin sons Ninian Wilfrid and Wilfrid
Ninian respectively so that if one of us got knocked out the survivor
might still be a Ninian Guyse Wolfs wife might almost as well call
herself Mrs Ninian Guyse as you might As he wanted the thing kept
dark he would be very likely to use his other name It was an obvious
precaution As to the writing Wolf and I write so alike that our hands
are often mistaken for one another There is however one letter that
we make quite differently and that is our initial N I always write it
plain like a printed N and Wolf writes it as on this address My
mother might not notice that because I am always with her and she
doesnt often see my signature But I think I could easily convince any
impartial person that I didnt write that address He felt in his
pocket brought out some letters from his brother addressed to himself
and showed the initial N exactly as it appeared on the letter Then he
went to the bureau and fetched out a letter which he had just written to
a local correspondent The N at the foot where his signature appeared
was as he had said quite different Rather tiresome isnt it that
I can only clear myself in Madams eyes by incriminating Wolf She
thinks a hundred times more of him than she does of me I cant tell
tales of him

She contemplated his serious absorbed face and laughed out aloud in
the completeness of her relief Oh Nin said she you are a
darling

His expression changed like lightning to its most wicked twinkle

Come he said were getting on Thats the very first pretty name
you ever called meare you aware of that my porcelain rogue

I prefer being a schoolmarm and a white crane and a blue thing with a
red nose to any amount of darlings was her contented reply


Madams condition changed for the better that evening The following
afternoon when the Colonel arrived he found her much improved

He had been a good deal mystified upon his arrival at Picton Bars to
find Miss Inness RollsRoyce and chauffeur awaiting him

Goddard told him that the young lady was staying at the Pele and thus
he was more or less prepared for the state of affairs which he found
upon arrival

Ninian and Olwen were having tea in the banquetinghall They were
sitting in the oriel and at the moment of his entry Ninian was wholly
absorbed in demonstrating that he could fold his fiances hand within
his own so that it was completely concealed and could be withdrawn
without his unlocking a single finger

Olwen received her future brotherinlaw graciously enough but with a
new reserve in her manner which he felt uncomfortably

Ninian explained to him their plan which was to be married at once
without any kind of pomp so that he might take his bride to Italy or
the Pyrenees until his health was thoroughly reestablished

I shall invite nobody but my grandfather and my two unmarried aunts
said Olwen but there is one person whose presence I particularly
desire and that is your wife Wilfrid

My wife he said with first a flash of anger and then a hesitation
a dark look at his twin There was a pause which they left it to him
to break

I had no idea that my brother knew he said at last very coldly

He did not until I told him replied Miss Innes Your wife wrote to
me I feel sure that she wrote for my sake not for her own It
happened that I had been kind to some cousin of hers and she thought
she ought to warn me that you were not free

His eyes flashed If I had been free what price Ninians chance he
asked with a sneer

No human creature has a chance as long as Nin is above ground was her
tender reply I only liked talking to you because every now and then
you are so astonishingly like himsuperficially

Well Nin I congratulate you from the bottom of my heart said Wolf
in a softer tone

I feel as if seeing that I am going to be one of the family I ought
to scold you Wolf said Olwen But somehow I cant I feel too
happy to scold However there is one thing I must do and that is to
set you a penance I want you to go upstairs to Madamshe is much
better this eveningand tell her quite quietly and simply that Lily is
your wife You owe this to Ninian for she is quite sure that it is he
who has done what you have done I must tell you frankly that until
you do this and acknowledge your wife you and I wont be friends

Ninian interposed in a bashful muttering fashion Dont ask him to
tell her She loves him best and it doesnt hurt her half as much to
think I have done a shabby thing as it would to think that he had

Olwen lifted her gaze to the Colonels moody handsome face Her eyes
were alight with joy and pride in her lover You hear that Wolf she
asked a little chokily Thats your brotheryour twin wont you show
yourself worthy of him Must all the generosity be his to the very
end

His look dwelt upon her half resentment half admiration By jove
Ninian you and I are going to be shown our places now arent we he
sneered

Always told her she was a schoolmarm replied Nin his mouth curved
sideways into his most crooked grin

Wolf turned away with an envious look under his eyelashes He walked
the length of the room came slowly back halfway wavered a minute
then went out closing the door behind him

It wont hurt her Nin said Olwen gently she likes Lily and she
has brooded for so long over what she imagined to be your deceit It is
best to tell her the truth and then I can write to Lily tonight and
invite her to the wedding

Trust you to manage it all remarked he with a chuckle of intense
satisfaction

Project Gutenberg depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of
equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations 1 to
5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with
the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations where
we have not received written confirmation of compliance To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state

have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside
the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenberg electronic
works


Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US unless
a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks
in compliance with any particular paper edition

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBooks eBook
number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII
compressed zipped HTML and others

Corrected editions of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed
Versions based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

 httpwwwgutenbergorg

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg including
how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to
our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks
